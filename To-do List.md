Admin Report:

General Observations: Things are getting smoother! We seem to be coming out of the turbulence from all of the changes we've made in the first couple of weeks. Manually checking in the students for 102R has been a helpful way for me to remember student names and improve in my role as the face of the Center every morning. It's been nice to see everybody start to get in a good flow, both coaches and students alike.

Specific Observations:
1. Missing list of menus since new game plan sheet was made. Several coaches asked me about this last week; the new Game Plan does not have a list of the menus like the old one did. The coaches who had asked about it were hoping to show their students the list of menus, but could not because we don't have a list on the Game Plan anymore. The quickest fix is just having our coaches memorize the names of each menu, but it might be convenient to have a list of the menus accessible to students.
2. Coaches consistently arriving at shift start time or 1-2 minutes after, instead of 5-10 minutes before for paid prep time. Perhaps a reminder of the need to arrive early in our next weekly announcement would help? I also might just be seeing this because I am on the opening shift, and it's especially hard to get moving and out of the door when it's cold outside. 
3. Study Hall check-in kiosk reverts from Study Hall Center to Math Study Center on its own from time-to-time. We can fix it manually, but that requires (1) that we notice it, and (2) that we are free from questions/students/tasks to fix it. If something can be done on the I-Plan end to keep it from switching centers on its own, that would be fantastic. For now, just making sure all of the admins know how to fix it will be sufficient.
