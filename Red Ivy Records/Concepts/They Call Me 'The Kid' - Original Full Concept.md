They Call Me ‘The Kid’ (Full Concept)
——————————(Falling Up)
[Alarm clock starts abruptly]
“...a dream?”
[Alarm clock cuts out]
[Yawn]
[Begin drumbeat and bass line.]
“Why can’t you just let it go? What’s past is passed.”
[Lead guitar part starts.]

[Crashing sound effect at the end of the bassline and drumbeat, fade into wind sound effect.]
————————(World Walker’s Travesty)
[Ease in acoustic strumming. Quiet electric guitar fills between verses.]

Up in the mountains
A man treks alone.
Snow piled high
Chilling him to the bone.

Soaked through-and-through
Walking in the sage
The man wonders how
He had gotten to this stage.

Lost in his mind
Memories from the past
How had he sensed 
That those things wouldn’t last?

They called him World Walker -
No home did he know.
Carrying his guitar,
Forward did he go.

From stage to stage and place to place
No city claimed his name
Every town and village though
Was awed in his fame.

And so he traveled round and round
Career on the rise
All the while in envy
Men they plotted his demise.

Flying high, up in the sky
A single little plane
Over purple mountaintops
Was where it would remain

The crew had all jumped ship
Leaving one on his own.
Gazing out the window
Oblivious to what’s sown.

Readily the plane drifts down
Crashing fantastically.
Everyone did think our
Man was gone, so they flee.

But up there in the mountains
A man walks alone.
Snow piled high
Chilling him to the bone.

[Fade wind back in and fade song out. Bring in heart rate monitor and fade it out on a flatline with the wind. Bring in a sharp inhale and heavy breathing, like waking up in a cold sweat.]
————————(To Your Side)

“How could I forget?!”

[Begin fading in “To Your Side”’s drum beat. High energy scrambling sfx, like getting ready in a rush. Door slamming shut, then hurried footsteps. Slow the footsteps to a stop.]

(Female voice, kinda distant.) “Yes, hello, how can I help you? ... Alright, if you’ll just follow me this way.” 

[Different footsteps from before, much more collected and professional than the running.]

“There she is, that’s her. Just breathe, relax, you’ll be fine.”

[fade in the rest of To Your Side’s instrumental, for the intro.]

When you watch me shyly
Catch my eye and try me.
Get me to your side, baby.

Girl you’re really talkin’ sweet
Always knock me off my feet.
I’m to your side, won’t miss a beat.

When I’m high and when I’m low
I know exactly where to go.
I’m gone to your side, girl.

From the moment that I met you
You just know I had to get you
Opening me up inside, I’ve fallen right there to your side.

[Fade out string instrumental, transition from To Your Side’s drums to Studio Sample #2’s drums.]
————————(Studio Sample #2 (Just Say You Love Me))
[Original footsteps, easy pace.]

“Excuse me, hi, sorry. Can I talk to you for a moment?”
(Fem. voice) “Sure, what do you need?”
“Well, I was wondering...”
[Fade in Studio Sample #2’s strings for the intro.]

Hey babe, you’re lovely, let’s make some magic happen.
Hey babe, you’re lovely, let’s make some magic happen.
Now I’m hoping dearly that you’ll say you love me.

[decrease instrumental volume]
“Would you like to get drinks some time?”
[bring instrumental back to full volume]

Looking forward to May, when springtime’s in full sway.
Looking forward to May, when springtime’s in full sway.
Hope to be home in Reno, with a girl who’s as beautiful as day.

[decrease instrumental volume]
(Fem voice) “Sure! I’m free when my shift ends tonight, where do you wanna meet?”
[bring instrumental back to full volume]

[Lead guitar solo. Feel should be timeless, like it’s been awhile since the last verse ever played.]

“If I asked, would you know?” It was a bit hypothetical.
“If I asked, would you know?” It was a bit hypothetical.
Now I’m not asking hypothetically, baby do you love me?
[Fade out instrumental. Birds chirping, springtime, etc.]
————————(The Song Without a Name)
[Fade in instrumental for Song Without a Name while fading out springtime sfx.]

It’s four o’clock in the early morning
You’re asleep, but I’m still yawning
Watching you, I wonder why
I somehow seemed to catch your eye

As we walked our dusty town
I never thought to wear a frown
Having you there next to me
It kept me happy as can be

Now I’m singing the song without a name,
you’re the only thing that’s keeping me sane
I feel relaxed when you’re around
Head in the sky, feet on the ground

[Happy-go-lucky piano/keyboard solo]

[Fade out instrumental. Fade in distant freeway traffic (occasional cars going by, stuff like that. Probably put a low pass filter on it to make it sound like it’s outside)]
“What do you mean, no? We’ve been together for so long now!”
(Fem voice) “I’m sorry. I just can’t. I don’t want to lead you on any longer, it wouldn’t be right. Goodbye.”
[Door opens quickly, then closes softly.]
“But... why? What did I... do..?”
[Soft crying, occasional sniffling. Fade out background noise.]
————————(Superficial)
[Fade in Superficial]

You make my mind fly
You make my heart sigh
What made us work?
What took it away?

I can still feel your fingers
Laced between mine
Wasn’t I yours?
Remember you were mine?

[Guitar solo uno]

Was it all just superficial?
Was it all just superficial?
Was it all just superficial?
Who can say?

For but a moment I held you
Your head resting on mine
Our hearts were connected;
Our souls intertwined.

Where can I find an answer?
When will I say goodbye?
Just tell me what I did
It couldn’t be “not you, just me”!

[Guitar solo part deuce]

Was it all just superficial?
Was it all just superficial?
Was it all just superficial?
Who can really say?

[Ending guitar solo]
[Fade out Superficial on a single guitar note.]
————————(The Song Without a Name (Reprise))
[Halfheartedly sing the last bit of Song Without a Name]

“Looking ‘round I see the mess 
“That was caused by my being jealous
“I should’ve left quite long ago
“So that I never hurt you so”

“Now I’m singing the song without a name,
“There’s no hook to keep my mind in one frame
“I feel so tense now that you’re gone
“I’ll take a cry, ‘cause my heart’s done.”

[Fade in ambiance. Coffee shop-type atmosphere.]
“Thanks for spending so much time with me lately. I really appreciate it.”
(Fem voice 2) “Of course! It’s the least I can do.”
“I just... I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. Especially with you leaving for so long.”
(Fem voice 2) “You’ll be okay. I believe in you! Just remember, it’s been awhile since ‘that’ happened. You don’t have to let it bother you any more. Now, I’ll be home again when school’s finished. Love you!”

[Fade out ambiance.]
————————(Don’t Cry, It’s Over Now)
[Fade in Don’t Cry, It’s Over Now]

Even when I’m feeling down, I think of you and it cheers me up again
The two of us, just hanging out, pretending we could fall in love and then,
I remember what happened.

Walking down my street I pass the seats we used to frequent at the park.
It’s raining and it’s cold, I think of when you took my coat there in the dark.

“Don’t cry, it’s over now.”
I wouldn’t, anyhow.
It’s not the way I roll, you see.
At times I wish that weren’t me.
But then you speak your mind,
And it brings peace to mine.
“Don’t cry, it’s over now.”

[Some kind of instrumental solo]

[Fade out instrumental]
————————(Frozen In Time)
[Fade in wind.]
(Newscaster) “Also tonight, expect temperatures below freezing throughout the northern areas of the region. Any frozen precipitation is sure to be pretty with that full moon; Glenn?”
[Fade out wind, fade in Frozen In Time]

Curtains closed, it’s after midnight.
Whateva I’m doin’, is it alright?
Checked outside, all was pretty bright.
Is it just me, or is this night white?

Frosty reflections wherev’r I go,
Have no objections, what do I know?

I’m frozen in time, 
(Better hold fast.)
I’m frozen in time,
(Why does this sorrow last?)
I’m frozen in time,
(Help me move on.)
I’m frozen in time,
(Before my life’s gone!)

Aimlessly, I wander around.
Haplessly, feet dragging on the ground.
Hopelessly, can I really walk away?
Endlessly, this feels like Groundhog Day!

[instrumental break, solo overtop, Verse chords x2]

I’m frozen in time, 
(Better hold fast.)
I’m frozen in time,
(Why can’t I ditch my past?)
I’m frozen in time,
(Help me move on.)
I’m frozen in time,
(Before my life’s gone!)

I’m frozen in time,
(And hanging on tight!) 
I’m frozen in time,
(But I haven’t lost the fight!) 
I’m frozen in time,
(Just can’t move on.) 
I’m frozen in time...

[Fade out to silence for ~6-10 seconds]
————————(12 Year Blues)
[Door closing softly, grocery bags setting down on table. Text message alert.]
“Huh. Haven’t heard from you since that one night after my breakup...”
[12 Year Blues intro begins.]

Stayed to grow, when I wanted to go; what do you know, 12 year blues
Wish we hadn’t played, I’m feeling quite dazed; what can you say, it’s 12 year blues
If every rose has its thorn you must have been one in my side
All that poking and prodding left a scar that’s quite wide

After that drop, I couldn’t yet stop. Fell off the top, in 12 year blues
Together one night, you held me just right; out in plain sight, those 12 year blues
They all seemed to think we’re watching shadows on the wall
Once you’ve made it big, go and give me a call

[Guitar solo]

Out on a limb to ask you back in, my heart’s worn thin with 12 year blues
I’ll be out for two; wait for me, won’t you?
Something something, 12 year blues
Back when we were young I didn’t know how to feel
Now that we’re older, come home; I need to know if it’s real

[Lower instrumental volume]
“Hmph. Glad to hear you’ll be home soon. Too bad I won’t be around long after that...”
[Raise instrumental volume back to normal.]

Leaving to grow, not staying to know, I have to roll with 12 year blues
After awhile I’ll stop to smile, one more mile of 12 year blues
Out from home and in the unknown, it’s safe to leave those 12 year blues
Finally free from those 12 year blues

[Fade out 12 Year Blues instrumental, except for the drums.]
————————(It’s All a Dream)
[Drum solo]

[Drums continue, guitars and bass come in.]

“Everything has a beginning and an end. Life is just a cycle of starts and stops. There are ends we don’t desire, but they’re inevitable. We have to face them. It’s what being human is all about.”

I stop and you go,
You’re fast and I’m slow.
None of it has any meaning,
All is just a state of being.

You’re here and I’m there
We've both been everywhere.
At our highs and in our lows
Reality’s just what we know.

You were good and I was bad,
We were happy, now we're sad
And it's driving both us mad! 

I see black and white,
I feel day and night,
There’s no shade of grey in sight.

We’ve all got stakes in this plight life,
Balanced on the edge of a knife.

And when you wake from this transient state,
The image in your mind will dissipate.

[Abrupt end to the music, replaced by alarm clock sfx from beginning.]

“It was all...

[Alarm clock sfx makes a perfect loop]
