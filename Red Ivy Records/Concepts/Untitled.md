[Alarm clock starts abruptly]  
“...a dream?”  
[Alarm clock cuts out]  
[Yawn]  
[Begin drumbeat and bass line.]  
“Late to bed and early to rise makes a man tired, but gives him more time.”  
  
I’m so tired of the push and pull it’s  
All the biggest load of bullets  
I know that you can’t ev’n help it  
And I know that you’re not worth it  
  
“Why can’t you just let it go? What’s past is passed.”  
  
  
  
[Crashing sound effect at the end of the bassline and drumbeat, fade into wind sound effect.]  
————————(World Walker’s Travesty)  
[Ease in acoustic strumming. Bring in bass and drumbeat on “Up”.]  
  
Up in the mountains  
A man treks alone.  
Snow piled high  
Chilling him to the bone.  
  
Soaked through-and-through  
Walking in the sage  
The man wonders how  
He had gotten to this stage.  
  
Lost in his mind  
Memories from the past  
How had he sensed  
That those things wouldn’t last?  
  
They called him World Walker -  
No home did he know.  
Carrying his guitar,  
Forward did he go.  
  
From stage to stage and place to place  
No city claimed his name  
Every town and village though  
Was awed in his fame.  
  
And so he traveled round and round  
Career on the rise  
All the while in envy  
Men they plotted his demise.  
  
Flying high, up in the sky  
A single little plane  
Over purple mountaintops  
Was where it would remain  
  
The crew had all jumped ship  
Leaving one on his own.  
Gazing out the window  
Oblivious to what’s sown.  
  
Readily the plane drifts down  
Crashing fantastically.  
Everyone did think our  
Man was gone, so they flee.  
  
But up there in the mountains  
A man walks alone.  
Snow piled high  
Chilling him to the bone.  
  
[Fade wind back in and fade song out. Bring in heart rate monitor and fade it out on a flatline with the wind. Bring in a sharp inhale and heavy breathing, like waking up in a cold sweat.]  
————————(To Your Side)  
  
“How could I forget?!”  
  
[Begin fading in “To Your Side”’s drum beat. High energy scrambling sfx, like getting ready in a rush. Door slamming shut, then hurried footsteps. Slow the footsteps to a stop.]  
  
(Female voice, kinda distant.) “Yes, hello, how can I help you? ... Alright, if you’ll just follow me this way.”  
  
[Different footsteps from before, much more collected and professional than the running.]  
  
“There she is, that’s her. Just breathe, relax, you’ll be fine.”  
  
[fade in the rest of To Your Side’s instrumental, for the intro.]  
  
When you watch me shyly  
Catch my eye and try me.  
Get me to your side, baby.  
  
Girl you’re really talkin’ sweet  
Always knock me off my feet.  
I’m to your side, won’t miss a beat.  
  
When I’m high and when I’m low  
I know exactly where to go.  
I’m gone to your side, girl.  
  
From the moment that I met you  
You just know I had to get you  
Opening me up inside, I’ve fallen right there to your side.  
  
[Fade out string instrumental, transition from To Your Side’s drums to Studio Sample #2’s drums.]  
————————(Studio Sample #2 (Just Say You Love Me))  
[Original footsteps, easy pace.]  
  
Hey babe, you’re lovely, let’s make some magic happen.  
Hey babe, you’re lovely, let’s make some magic happen.  
Now I’m hoping dearly that you’ll say you love me.  
  
Looking forward to May, when springtime’s in full sway.  
Looking forward to May, when springtime’s in full sway.  
Hope to be home in Reno, with a girl who’s beautiful as day.  
  
“If I asked, would you know?” It was a bit hypothetical.  
“If I asked, would you know?” It was a bit hypothetical.  
Now I’m not asking hypothetically, baby do you love me?  
  
[Fade out instrumental. Birds chirping, springtime, etc.]  
————————(The Song Without a Name)  
[Fade in instrumental for Song Without a Name while fading out springtime sfx.]  
  
It’s four o’clock in the early morning  
You’re asleep, but I’m still yawning  
Watching you, I wonder why  
I somehow seemed to catch your eye  
  
As we walked around our dusty town  
I never thought to wear a frown  
Having you there next to me  
It kept me happy as can be  
  
Now I’m singing the song without a name,  
you’re the only thing that’s keeping me sane  
I feel relaxed when you’re around  
Head in the sky, feet on the ground  
  
[Happy-go-lucky piano/keyboard solo]  
  
[Fade out instrumental. Fade in distant freeway traffic (occasional cars going by, stuff like that. Probably put a low pass filter on it to make it sound like it’s outside)]  
“What do you mean, no? We’ve been together for so long now!”  
(Fem voice) “I’m sorry. I just can’t. I don’t want to lead you on any longer, it wouldn’t be right. Goodbye.”  
[Door opens quickly, then closes softly.]  
“But... why? What did I... do..?”  
[Soft crying, occasional sniffling. Fade out background noise.]  
————————(Superficial)  
[Fade in Superficial]  
  
You make my mind fly  
You make my heart sigh  
What made us work?  
What took it away?  
  
I can still feel your fingers  
Laced between mine  
Wasn’t I yours?  
Remember you were mine?  
  
Was it all just superficial?  
Was it all just superficial?  
Was it all just superficial?  
Who can say?  
  
For but a moment I held you  
Your head resting on mine  
Our hearts were connected;  
Our souls intertwined.  
  
Where can I find an answer?  
When will I learn to say goodbye?  
Just tell me what I did  
It couldn’t be “not you, just me”!  
  
[Guitar solo uno]  
  
Was it something I said?  
Was it something I did?  
Was it all just superficial?  
Who can really say?  
  
[Ending guitar solo]  
[Fade out Superficial on a single guitar note.]  
————————(The Song Without a Name (Reprise))  
[Halfheartedly sing the last bit of Song Without a Name]  
  
“Looking ‘round I see the mess  
“That was caused by my being jealous  
“I should’ve left quite long ago  
“So that I never hurt you so”  
  
“Now I’m singing the song without a name,  
“There’s no hook to keep my mind in one frame  
“I feel so tense now that you’re gone  
“I’ll take a cry, ‘cause my heart’s done.”  
————————(The Real Folk Blues) {Cover}  
  
Too late to let you know, what you mean to me  
If I cried I’d only make you believe I was happy  
I’ve got to let you go, and my heart it aches  
But it’s worth it, ‘cause I swear to God, you’re a mistake  
  
Know there could be a day, when the pain will fade  
But a part of me is lookin’ for you, back on yesterday  
I’ve got to get away, ‘cause my heart, it burns  
And I know if I keep stickin’ around, I won’t ever learn  
  
Don’t wanna cry  
‘Cause, baby, I  
Can feel freedom when they play  
  
The real folk blues  
I need the pain  
My unhappiness is proof I’m not insane  
‘Cause when I’m close to you  
I swear, I could die  
Need to live my life, yeah, live like I’m alive  
And it’s a lonely road  
Good luck and goodbye  
  
[Instrumental Solo, akin to the ending of Clapton's Layla]  
  
—————————(Sleepless in Sierra)  
[Angry yell/shout/scream/idk for like, a hot minute]  
  
Can’t we all just, get over it please?  
That’d be nice, would make life a breeze.  
  
‘Cause it’s keeping me up, alone all night  
It’s keeping me up, without my light  
It’s keeping me up, keeping me sleepless  
  
Just fly away, give it some time  
I’ll cry away all I had in mind  
Make no mistake, I’d always loved you  
I wasn’t a fake, now we’re no longer two  
It’s keeping me up, I’m sleepless without you  
  
Did we forget that innocence is bliss?  
I never thought that innocence I’d miss.  
  
‘Cause it’s keeping me up, alone all night  
It’s keeping me up, without my light  
It’s keeping me up, I’m sleepless in Sierra  
  
Just fly away, give it some time  
I’ll cry away all I had in mind  
Make no mistake, I’d always loved you  
I wasn’t a fake, now we’re no longer two  
It’s keeping me up, I’m sleepless without you  
  
Please do remind me to get over you  
I can’t believe I gave control to you  
  
The fact’s keeping me up, alone all night  
I’m done falling up, just put out my light  
It’s stringing me up, I’m sleepless in Sierra  
  
Just fly away, give it some time  
I’ll cry away all I had in mind  
Make no mistake, I’d always loved you  
I wasn’t a fake, now we’re no longer two  
It’s keeping me up, I’m sleepless without you  
  
Just fly away, give it some time  
I’ll cry away all I had in mind  
Make no mistake, I’d always loved you  
I wasn’t a fake, now we’re no longer two  
It’s keeping me up, I’m sleepless without you  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh...

[OG Male Singer for choruses]  
  
I’ll sing you a song  
Day and night, any time at all  
Oh I’ll sing you a song  
And if you need, just give me a call  
And I’ll sing you a song  
  
I’ll be there ev’ry time

Any time that you need mine  
For if you need, just give me a call  
And I’ll be there ev’ry time  
  
Oh what to do, oh what to do;  
I’m simply stuck without loving you.  
Oh what to do, oh what to do;  
Who’d hope to fill the hole from my blues?  
  
I’ll play you a tune  
Day and night, any time at all

And when you need, oh don’t wait to call  
I will be there for you  
  
[Fade in ambiance. Coffee shop-type atmosphere.]  
“Thanks for spending so much time with me lately. I really appreciate it.”  
(Fem voice 2) “Of course! It’s the least I can do.”  
“I just... I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. Especially with you leaving for so long.”  
(Fem voice 2) “You’ll be okay. I believe in you! Just remember, it’s been awhile since ‘that’ happened. You don’t have to let it bother you any more. Now, I’ll be home again when school’s finished. Love you!”  
  
[Fade out ambiance.]  
————————(Don’t Cry, It’s Over Now)  
[Fade in Don’t Cry, It’s Over Now]  
  
Even when I’m feeling down, I think of you and it cheers me up again  
The two of us, just hanging out, pretending we could fall in love and then,  
I remember what happened.  
  
Walking down my street I pass the seats we used to frequent at the park.  
It’s raining and it’s cold, I think of when you took my coat there in the dark.  
  
“Don’t cry, it’s over now.”  
I wouldn’t, anyhow.  
It’s not the way I roll, you see.  
At times I wish that weren’t me.  
But then you speak your mind,  
And it brings peace to mine.  
“Don’t cry, it’s over now.”  
  
[Some kind of instrumental solo]

(Newscaster) “Also tonight, expect temperatures below freezing throughout the northern areas of the region. Any frozen precipitation is sure to be pretty with that full moon; Glenn?”  
[Fade out wind, fade in Frozen In Time]  
  
Curtains closed, it’s after midnight.  
Whateva I’m doin’, is it alright?  
Checked outside, all was pretty bright.  
Is it just me, or is this night white?  
  
Frosty reflections wherev’r I go,  
Have no objections, what do I know?  
  
I’m frozen in time,  
(Better hold fast.)  
I’m frozen in time,  
(Why does this sorrow last?)  
I’m frozen in time,  
(Help me move on.)  
I’m frozen in time,  
(Before my life’s gone!)  
  
Aimlessly, I wander around.  
Haplessly, feet dragging on the ground.  
Hopelessly, can I really walk away?  
Endlessly, this feels like Groundhog Day!  
  
[instrumental break, solo overtop, Verse chords x2]  
  
I’m frozen in time,  
(Better hold fast.)  
I’m frozen in time,  
(Why can’t I ditch my past?)  
I’m frozen in time,  
(Help me move on.)  
I’m frozen in time,  
(Before my life’s gone!)  
  
I’m frozen in time,  
And hanging on tight!  
I’m frozen in time,  
But I haven’t lost the fight!  
I’m frozen in time,  
Just can’t move on.  
I’m frozen in time...

————————(Rain) {Cover}  
  
I don't feel a thing  
And I stopped remembering  
The days are just like moments turned to hours  
  
Mother Used to say  
If you want, you'll find a way  
But mother never danced through fire shower  
  
Walk in the rain, in the rain, in the rain  
I walk in the rain, in the rain  
Is it right or is it wrong  
And is it here that I belong  
  
I don't hear a sound  
Silent faces in the ground  
The quiet screams, but I refuse to listen  
  
If there is a hell  
I'm sure this is how it smells  
Wish this were a dream, but no, it isn't  
  
Walk in the rain, in the rain, in the rain  
I walk in the rain, in the rain  
Am I right or am I wrong  
And is it here that I belong  
  
Walk in the rain, in the rain, in the rain  
I walk in the rain, in the rain  
Why do I feel so alone  
For some reason I think of home

————————(12 Year Blues)  
[Door closing softly, grocery bags setting down on table. Text message alert.]  
“Huh. Haven’t heard from you since that one night after my breakup...”  
[12 Year Blues intro begins.]  
  
Stayed to grow, when I wanted to go; what do you know, 12 year blues  
Wish we hadn’t played, I’m feeling quite dazed; what can you say, it’s 12 year blues  
If every rose has its thorn you must have been one in my side  
All that poking and prodding left a scar that’s quite wide  
  
After that drop, I couldn’t yet stop. Fell off the top, in 12 year blues  
Together one night, you held me just right; out in plain sight, those 12 year blues  
They all seemed to think we’re watching shadows on the wall  
Once you’ve made it big, go and give me a call  
  
[Guitar solo]  
  
Out on a limb to ask you back in, my heart’s worn thin with 12 year blues  
I’ll be out for two; wait for me, won’t you?  
Something something, 12 year blues  
Back when we were young I didn’t know how to feel  
Now that we’re older, come home; I need to know if it’s real  
  
[Lower instrumental volume]  
“Hmph. Glad to hear you’ll be back soon. Too bad I won’t be around long after that...”  
[Raise instrumental volume back to normal.]  
  
Leaving to grow, not staying to know, I have to roll with 12 year blues  
After awhile I’ll stop to smile, one more mile of 12 year blues  
Out from home and in the unknown, it’s safe to leave those 12 year blues  
Finally free from those 12 year blues  
  
[Fade out 12 Year Blues instrumental, except for the drums.]  
————————(It’s All a Dream)  
[Drum solo]  
  
[Drums continue, guitars and bass come in.]  
  
“Everything has a beginning and an end. Life is just a cycle of starts and stops. There are ends we don’t desire, but they’re inevitable. We have to face them. It’s what being human is all about.”  
  
I stop and you go,  
You’re fast and I’m slow.  
None of it has any meaning,  
All of it’s a state of being.  
  
You’re here and I’m there  
We’ve both been everywhere.  
At our highs and in our lows  
Our reality’s just what we know.  
  
You’re good and I’m bad,  
We’ve both been happy and sad.  
These concepts are all mental  
And they’re all driving the people mad  
  
I see black, I see white,  
I feel day, I know night,  
There’s not a shade of grey in sight.  
We’ve all got stakes in this plight life,  
Balanced on the edge of a knife.  
  
And when you wake from this transient state,  
The image in your mind will dissipate.  
  
[Abrupt end to the music, replaced by alarm clock sfx from beginning.]
