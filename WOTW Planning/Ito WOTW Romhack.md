Is it better to use the WOTW romhack base or to build from the ground up in Lex Talionis?

- Entire soundtrack is just Eric Clapton songs in FE6's soundfont
	- MIDI files need to be sourced, then converted to FE6's instrument map
	- Determine number of necessary tracks
- Story:
	- Begin with a prologue chapter; weak [[Ito Kai|Ito]] (OG sprite?), Luci's death, Caelin's overthrow, etc.
	- Chapters should follow his adventures in different areas
		- Village rescue fail + Inese conversation
		- Bernese adventures with Lunie & Co.
		- Sacae arc with [[Theos Aletheios|Theos]]
		- "Reforging" arc, post-Swordmaster promotion
		- Return to Caelin
			- Lunie re-enters story when leaving Sacae?
			- New characters for story?
		- Liberate Caelin
			- Is this the climax?
		- Resolution?
