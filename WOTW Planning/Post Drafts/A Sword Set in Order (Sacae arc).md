[[Ito Kai|Ito]] walked casually, crossing the northern border of Bern into Sacae. The breeze of the plains kissed the open flesh on his left cheek; a wound he had sustained in his last encounter with Bernese bandits. He touched it gently with his left hand, casting his mind back to the occasion. 

*How foolish I was, to have let him get so close.*

Ito had been caught between Bonerock and a hard place, frantically navigating the woods near that cave as he foolishly engaged himself in the rescue of Lunie and her friends. They might not have needed him, but his time with Lunie had begun to develop feelings of friendship and camaraderie, almost in spite of the tough exterior Ito always tried to portray. Some bandit had gotten the drop on him as they made their escape, each in a seemingly separate direction. Ito's head was lost in the mess of the situation, and he only heard it at the last moment--a twig snapped, and he looked in the bandit's direction right as his arrow was loosed. Things happened almost too quickly; Ito couldn't avoid it, but his best reaction was to twist his head mere moments before the arrow struck. Its tip sliced his face, enraging the swordsman. The close quarters of the woodland scene meant the archer was close enough for Ito to have burst forward, sword drawn, to strike back before another shot could be taken. That burst and the ensuing scuffle with the archer sapped Ito's remaining strength, and the adrenaline of his injury was all he had left to carry himself deep enough into the woods to find safety.

Following a brief period of recovery and resupply in a small Bernese village, he had travelled toward Sacae. He wasn't ready to return home, yet. Deep in his soul, Ito knew things weren't right; and if he weren't prepared, how could he hope to succeed in his aim to liberate Caelin from its bandit plague?

Ito stopped to rest at a stream, enjoying the cool as he laid in the thick, green grass. Arising from a short nap, Ito removed a waterskin from his pack and consumed the remainder of its contents, then dipped it in the stream to refill. He peered in, gazing carefully at the forming scar that now occupied his face. *That's the last time I take such an injury because of my own carelessness, Luci.* Ito would carry that scar for the rest of his days, a reminder of this vow. It was as if that cut marked a covenant between himself and his ghost, haunted as he still was by the memory of his late wife.

*Be still, Ito. You've always been restless, but something's different. It's worse, now.*

Luci's voice echoed in his mind, and though it haunted him, her words were right. Reflecting on his last encounter sounded an alarm that something was off. He hadn't felt the same since then; less sure of himself, and uncertain of his course. If he could be taken off guard and marked so badly by some faceless bowman, he didn't stand a chance against those in a higher echelon.

Ito broke his staring contest with the stream, realizing his waterskin had long been refilled as he snapped out of what felt like a trance. Sealing the waterskin and packing it away, Ito laid back in the grass to attempt to doze again. He'd pick up his travel again later, when it felt right.

The northern mountains of Bern had mapped his direction of travel for him. Ito couldn't cross them directly with his current equipment, so he instead skirted their length, journeying far to the east to make his way into the Sacaean plains more broadly. His travel had taken him to Bulgar, where he spent a day resting and acquiring new gear. Replacing his well-worn Lycian armour, Ito purchased garb befitting a style more agile and controlled than his brutish approach. Having resupplied his travel rations and acquired additional resources to see him westward along the plains, Ito departed the city as suddenly as he had entered it. It didn't feel right to linger, so he left.

It was a long and lonely road. Ito's thoughts were filled with the presences of his previous companions. What was Lunie up to? Kyra, and Alphonz? Ito was confident that they had survived the ordeal at Bonerock Cave, but he hadn't encountered them since then. Would he ever meet them again, in a world as vast as this? These and countless similar questions encircled his mind, punctuated by thoughts of Luci and the faces of many others he had met since her passing.

The sky seemed to stretch out forever as Ito progressed along the plains. He felt small, smaller than he had anywhere else. Caelin's sky felt caged, comparatively. An apt metaphor for the present state of affairs there, as far as Ito knew them. Maybe the marquess and his remaining loyalists had recovered some ground, but Ito felt that such an outcome was unlikely given the way things were when he left. Perhaps Laus had made its move? He wouldn't know until he made his return.
