[[Ito Kai|Ito]] walked casually, crossing the northern border of Bern into Sacae. The breeze of the plains kissed the open flesh on his left cheek; a wound he had sustained in his last encounter with Bernese bandits. He touched it gently with his left hand, casting his mind back to the occasion. 

*How foolish I was, to have let him get so close.*

Ito had been caught between Bonerock and a hard place, frantically navigating the woods near that cave as he foolishly engaged himself in the rescue of Lunie and her friends. They might not have needed him, but his time with Lunie had begun to develop feelings of friendship and camaraderie, almost in spite of the tough exterior Ito always tried to portray. Some bandit had gotten the drop on him as they made their escape, each in a seemingly separate direction. Ito's head was lost in the mess of the situation, and he only heard it at the last moment--a twig snapped, and he looked in the bandit's direction right as his arrow was loosed. Things happened almost too quickly; Ito couldn't avoid it, but his best reaction was to twist his head mere moments before the arrow struck. Its tip sliced his face, enraging the swordsman. The close quarters of the woodland scene meant the archer was close enough for Ito to have burst forward, sword drawn, to strike back before another shot could be taken. That burst and the ensuing scuffle with the archer sapped Ito's remaining strength, and the adrenaline of his injury was all he had left to carry himself deep enough into the woods to find safety.

Following a brief period of recovery and resupply in a small Bernese village, he travelled toward Sacae. He wasn't ready to return home, yet. Deep in his soul, Ito knew things weren't right; and if he weren't prepared, how could he hope to succeed in his aim to liberate Caelin from its bandit plague?

Ito stopped to rest at a stream, enjoying the cool as he laid in the thick, green grass. Arising from a short nap, Ito removed a waterskin from his pack and consumed the remainder of its contents, then dipped it in the stream to refill. He peered in, gazing carefully at the forming scar that now occupied his face. *That's the last time I take such an injury because of my own carelessness, Luci.* Ito would carry that scar for the rest of his days, a reminder of this vow. It was as if that cut marked a covenant between himself and his ghost, haunted as he still was by the memory of his late wife.

*Be still, Ito. *
