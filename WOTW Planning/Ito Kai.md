## **Backstory**
Name: Ito Kai  
  
Class: Myrmidon  
  
Age: 24  
  
Born in: Caelin, Lycia  
  
Appearance: Standing at 5'10" and weighing in at 175 lbs, Ito's expression is shown only through calm. If eyes truly are the windows to the soul, Ito's brightly colored blue eyes are the only way to determine his feelings. The wildly messy blonde hair Ito sports hints at his style, while his lean, muscular build shows great strength and confidence. His movements show care and finesse, especially in each move he makes in combat.  
  
Personality: Once energetic and uncontainably bright in emotion, Ito has buried those emotions deep inside himself. The tremendous amount of grief he's felt in his life stills haunts him, and he's kept all the pain bottled up for years. Ito only expresses this pain in combat, using the raw emotion to fuel his aggressive combat style. When not in combat, Ito retains a very calm and collected manner, never reacting harshly to anything. The small things Ito does hint at a kind, caring side to him, but because of his familial losses he is much more subtle about it. Since his loss, Ito has gained an extreme hero complex, which could also be perceived as a type of death wish.  
  
Story: Although he hails from a smaller part of Lycia, Ito was in no way raised poorly. His family worked very closely with one of Caelin's military leaders, and as such Ito received one of the best educations available at the time. Unfortunately this was in the midst of war, so his main focus was learning how to survive. He always had some type of sword with him, ranging from the wooden practice swords to the iron sword his father owned. While on a trip to Ostia (before its destruction), Ito met a young lady and they quickly bonded, becoming fast friends and young lovers. Once they were both old enough, they were married and settled, but because bandits, monsters, and war had gotten much worse, it was no longer safe to live where they were. One night their small village was attacked by bandits, who heavily wounded some and killed many. Those who were heavily wounded and tried to escape were devoured by monsters and included Ito's wife, who was unable to survive even with Ito's best help. As his wife died, Ito did his best to fend off the monsters that attacked him, before he fell due to blood loss. Thankfully, Ito was saved by a small band of mercenaries that had a healer in their group. They couldn't do anything to save his wife however, as she had painfully died before Ito could fend off the monsters attacking her. Because he was grateful and needed to recover, Ito joined the group that saved him. For a while, Ito was somewhat happy, still able to express himself and feel joy because of the kindness of his new friends. While traveling near Etruria, however, they were mistaken for a Lycian scouting party, and were slaughtered without reason. Once again, Ito was the only one to survive, but this time because he had ran in fear. From this point on, the emotional pain was too much, and Ito suddenly felt like the only thing to do now in memory of his team and wife, was to be someone's hero. He wouldn't run anymore. He would use the training from his youth and from the time he spent as a mercenary to benefit him in rescuing people.  
  
It started out small, with the silent liberation of several small hamlets from bandit groups and monsters as he slowly made his way back to his home village, building his strength and skill. Eventually he got to the place he used to call home, which was now overrun by a decently sized group of bandits. The bandits had gotten lazy in the years since they took over, as they felt invincible in their homemade "fortress" in the village center. Ito snuck in one night, silently and quickly executing a large number of careless, drunk men that had once killed his family and friends. He made his way through the place and found their leader, who he challenged to a duel. The drunken bandit "king" was unable to keep up with Ito's speed and fluidity in motion, and was quickly eviscerated and killed. Ito, now finished with what he came to do, left under the cover of the remaining darkness and began his search for someone to save, a fear in the back of his mind that he wouldn't be able to live up to his emotional need to do so.

## **Character Journal (Thread Log)**
### Escape!
Ito’s night had been a rush. He had basically slaughtered an entire bandit’s guild, all in the name of “justice”. Was he mistaken? Had he gone about it all wrong? That couldn’t be… It was the bandits’ fault he’d lost his wife. The Etrurians had taken the lives of his former saviors. Ito wanted so very badly to get them next, but he needed time. Time to train, time to save, and time to kill. This would be his mission, to save innocents and deal evil to evil. Death to the murderers, the corrupt, and the monsters, both human and not.   
  
Although he’d been successful in his original task, he had to get out. Those he left alive would find him, if he didn’t leave now. Ito rushed through the small building, right hand on the hilt of his sheathed sword. His exit was as quick as his entrance, albeit less bloody and a lot quieter. His footsteps near silent, Ito used the dark of night to his advantage, and it seemed as though the darkness was willing to comply. This man who had murdered for justice would not be found guilty, nor likely found as he fled. He’d build his strength, and take on the rest of his opponents head-on in due time. All in due time…  
  
As Ito fled his former hometown, he hastily hopped over rocks and ran between the trees that trembled in the wind. If anyone were to find him now, they’d have to be watching carefully. His raiment stained by blood, Ito would definitely seem suspicious to anyone in their right mind, but who in their right mind would be out in the woods late into the night?

Asri hadn't changed her plan to look for opportunity in Etruria. The Elimine country was probably the strongest in this continent right now so it had highest probability to offer good job and safety. Bad luck came for her this time, unfortunately. Her trip through Caelin was delayed by the landslide that made the main road unusable. It was too late to reach a city like she had planned because the night had already descended. In the end, she was forced to spend the night in the forest. However, someone experienced with mobile and fast-paced lifestylle like Asri wouldn't be caught unprepared by this little obstacle.  
  
Before it became too dark, Asri had completed a simple camp with a tent and a firepit in a clearing next to the stream. Her horse was tied to nearby tree and the strong stallion had already slept, feeling tired after the long trip. As cautious as ever, the redhead had prepared safety measures against unwanted guests like wild animals or bandits. A thin and almost invisible string surrounded her camp, attached to the wood sticks that she had planted to the ground. In the middle of each line she had put small bells so if for some reason the string was pulled, stretched, or touched by someone or something, the bells would act like an alarm. Of course it wouldn't make loud sound but even a faint ring would be enough to tell Asri that someone had entered the perimeter. And as if it wasn't enough, Asri's self-made smoke bomb was attached to the entrance of the tent with a little modification that would make it explode if someone tried to enter the tent.   
  
Asri herself was sleeping comfortably in her bedroll and wrapped herself in blanket. The thief's cloak and leather vest were folded neatly and placed next to the bedroll along with her knives and short sword. A smile in her face showed that she was having a nice dream and good sleep.

After his initial escape, Ito's pace had slowed from a sprint to a jog. _Almost there,_ he thought, _then I'll be home free._ If he could remember correctly, there was a stream up ahead; that would be his destination. Running forward, Ito suddenly smelled what he thought was... smoke? Ito couldn't see far in front of him, but in the dark it would've been easy to make out a camp fire. However, he couldn't distinguish any light from one, so he kept going the same direction. Ito tripled his running pace; he could hear the stream now. The running water was close, and Ito planned to use it to wash the blood from his sword, armour, and clothing. _Almost there...  
  
**WHAM!**_ Ito gasped for breath, his impact with the ground knocking the air from his lungs. Was that a tripwire? In Ito's shocked mind it could very well have been anything from that to a magical force bent on his destruction. His senses came back to him, and he realized his ankle was caught. _So it was a tripwire..._ As Ito tried to get free, he heard the soft jingling of bells. He sat up, unwrapped the wire from his ankle and stood, desperately hoping the obnoxiously loud thud that accompanied his fall along with the bells wouldn't wake whoever set this trap, or anyone else in the area for that matter.  
  
As Ito looked around, he could see a basic camp, set up right next to the stream. He carefully unsheathed his sword and approached the stream, wiping the blood away as quickly and quietly as he could in the running water. Next would come his paldron and chestplate, so long as nobody caught him...

Alright, that was a very loud alarm...  
  
Asri opened her eyes slowly. She hasn't been fully awake yet but that sound washed away most of her sleepiness. Making sure she didn't make unnecessary movement, the redhead tried to slide into the edge of the tent as quiet as possible. Something had invaded her campsite, could be a human or a wild bear. Asri was calm. She was already holding her dagger as she observed the entrance of the tent. Whatever outside might be a threat for her, it wouldn't hurt to be cautious.   
  
A minute passed, no one hadn't tried to enter the tent so far. Even if the intruder tried it, he would trigger the smoke bomb by her. Asri could hear faint sound out there but it was too vague for her to gain any information about the intruder. So, the thief carefully crawled to the exit after hastily wearing her leather vest, quickly disabled her own trap, and came outside with her dagger in hand. "Can't I have a good sleep? I am very worn out after the trip..." she thought, protesting for her disturbed sleep. For someone who had gotten unwanted guest, Asri looked pretty calm. In fact, she didn't seem to take it seriously. Her blue eyes examined the area, looking for anything or anyone that had caused that loud sound.  
  
And there he was...next to the stream doing some laundry... The intruder turned out to be a young man, maybe around Asri's age, and he seemed to be busy cleaning his equipment. Could it be that he came here by coincidence? Maybe he accidentally triggered the alarm. Well, such thing wasn't unlikely. Not everyone out there wanted to harm her so there was no need to become paranoid. Still, it was wise to make sure of his intention first and the red-haired thief was going to do that now.  
  
Asri watched her steps. After countless sneaking in and out treasury vaults and other places, she wouldn't want to make a novice mistake like accidentally kicking pebbles and making some loud footstep. The thief moved like a ghost when she sneaked behind Ito. She kept some safe distance between them in case this man turned out to be a threat. _"He needs to have a good explanation for making me go out at cold night like this. Geez, I should have bring my cloak,"_ she thought, shivering a bit. Whether Ito had noticed her presence or not, Asri was standing behind him with three small knives between the fingers of her right hand, ready to be thrown at the target.   
  
**"Don't make any sudden movement, handsome. I am going to put a nice hole your throat if I feel like to."** Asri speak playfully which made the threat sound like a mere joke. Unfortunately, she was serious. **"Please entertain me... Why are you here?"** she added.

Silver steel sliced through shadows in the mottled glow of moonlight, her surroundings wreathed in darkness but the immediate vicinity dimly visible as the light of the moon filtered through the trees around her. She didn't make a great deal of noise, but the swish of her hakama and feet skidding across the ground were barely audible nonetheless; less a ghost than a warrior fighting an invisible battle. But her foes were imaginary, born not of hatred but of ideals; designed not to kill her, but to teach her how to deal with those who would.  
  
Once, Kisaragi had scorned kata. Hokey and meaningless compared to real sparring, she'd thought. But years of practice had driven some inkling of their usefulness into her mind nonetheless - the value of repeating a motion ten thousand times until it was second nature - so that reacting to certain common strikes was not a matter of thought, but of reflex. Internalizing the basics of her trade so she could use her mind on observation and rational thought, not on the battle itself. And she hadn't had much opportunity at all to practice today, too busy helping out at a nearby village. So the Sacaen swordswoman fought against nothingness, rapt within her thoughts and her motions so thoroughly that she would never have noticed anyone's passage unless they were very close indeed... or unless they came crashing down on something, and bells started ringing.  
  
It was fair to say that she wasn't always the most observant individual when caught in the moment, but it was also fair to say that not even Kisaragi could totally ignore the sudden, man-made ruckus in the dead of night, and that par for the course she didn't have enough sense to avoid it.  
  
Whatever the case, it wasn't very difficult to follow the sound of... someone doing... something - washing? there was something disturbing the water anyways, not that she could see jack or crap through the trees. Trying her best to keep an eye out for ambushes and traps, the pint-sized paladin quietly wended her way to her destination... much slower than she would have liked, not being familiar at all with the surroundings like Asri might be. But she did get there without much issue, and thankfully the lighting was a little better in the clearing around the stream than it had been in the deep of the woods. At least enough to see there was someone naked(?) or at least unarmored in the stream, and before she could say anything, a playfully lilting, pleasant voice from somewhere off to the side - but in that sweetly feminine tone was buried a poison so foul it curdled and boiled.  
  
And they were armed, if that glint of steel was any indication. Asri was too far off and not well enough illuminated for Kisaragi to make any real judgement on what sort of weapon she might have, but from the limited perspective she had now, all she could see was a female bandit threatening an unarmed... person in the stream with cruelty, and, well, that didn't exactly gel with her ideals.  
  
Stepping out from the trees with her left hand on the hilt of her sheathed sword, Kisaragi faced the woman with a bit more casual surety than she was actually feeling, acutely aware that it was entirely possible there were a lot more people here than she realized and that she had no idea if the guy(?) in the stream was anything but a villain himself as well. But she refused to be partisan to a murder if there was any chance the victim was innocent. Her voice was neutral but clear, projected firmly, even if it still bore the unmistakable tint of youth that no amount of wishing would change.  
  
**"The same could be asked of you, miss. Threats of violence on those who may be innocent reflect poorly on you."**

Lycia. A place that was both far more desolate than Sacae, yet more alive. The land was not always so green and rolling. Many times, Mizu's feet had come to stride upon deadened brown soil that was deprived of it's oh-so important nutrients. Be it from over-farming, or poor weather and climate, at times the land was visibly decaying. However then there were the population centers. Cities and towns of various sizes scattered or littered about. The few times his nocturnal sleep cycle had been disrupted, which had exposed him to the diurnal population of Lycia, he saw more people gathered than almost any other moment in his life. At-least that many gathered in one relative location.  
  
All in all, he wasn't entirely _opposed_ to Lycia. The people were a varied handful of encounters. Apparently, in Lycia, Sacaen's were at times viewed as primitive from the comments he'd heard muttered or even at times spoken in his direction. However he had stuck to a nocturnal pattern so often that these moments were far and in-between. Enough so that he wasn't dissuaded from traversing the foreign territory further.  
  
Mizuyuki's hand gripped at the small arrow shaft he was currently carving, a light pile of wood shavings littering the small patch of grass before him; dancing orange flickering hues from the camp-fire he'd lit allowed him to see as his hands deftly whittled away at it. The knife that he used guided by a thumb to the flat back of the blade while he carved into the wood to make a rounded shaft. The black and green Yumi that he was whittling arrows to fire from resting on the ground beside him with his quiver of already finished or previously made arrows nestled away. Always one to keep his stock as full as possible, he was diligent to make a few arrows a night when the opportunity presented itself.   
  
The night had been quiet so far. Occasional pops from the campfire, or the crackling as wood was consumed by the voracious appetite of the burning light had really been his only distractions audibly. Aside that was, from the soft churning of the stream near his camp and the various sounds the insects and frogs made. The symphonic background harmony of nature, as it were. It was though, for the most part, a silent night.  
  
His head turned abruptly when he heard the distant jingling. Such an odd, and out of place noise. Something he was not accustomed to hearing, and admittedly was unsure he'd accurately heard. He knew the sound of bells well enough to identify it, but he wasn't sure why bells would be jingling in the starlit hours of the day. Caution and an already natural sense of edge had him well..on edge. Rising from his campsite, and lifting his bow over his shoulder to lightly rest it upon it's holster made by his shoulder strap and belt. The quiver was nestled a moment later nearly parallel to the ground along the length of his waist, resting against the small of his back. Mizu tucked his yukata over pale exposed upper torso so the single sleeve and half covered his shoulder. The other half of his upper torso nearly glowing from the contrast of his ghostly pale skin to the night's sky. The dragon tattoo along his torso standing out further as he quietly placed a hand to the hilt of the blade resting at his hip; quietly creeping through the brush with experience only a life-time in the wild could really generate. Knowing how to hunt, how to track, and how to avoid generating sound, he was accustomed to the path for moving about openly and swiftly without alerting others of his presence.  
  
A narrowed gaze scanned his path ahead, creeping with tucked poise towards what looked like another camp-site down stream. Upon closer approach, he was able to discern voices. Though _what_ they spoke was not plausible to hear, he could in-fact hear that words were being spoken. Fingers coiled tighter around the hilt of his blade and he moved closer to the camp. Close enough that the faintest of ghostly orange hues splashed along his figure to reveal part, while casting the other half in shadows that seemed all the darker due to the shade light usually created when cast upon something. It seemed to be..three.  
  
Two women, and one boy. The male far easier to spot, albeit nearly embraced by closeness of another while a third took the stance of what he guessed was an onlooker. Mizu could've drawn attention to himself, but why do that when they were so focused already. He would wait and observe the show unfolding further, hand silently resting in darkness atop the hilt of his blade in the event that things turned sour.

**"Don't make any sudden movement, handsome. I am going to put a nice hole your throat if I feel like to. Please entertain me... Why are you here?"**  
  
Ito dropped his shirt into the stream in surprise. He had been caught, and now had to come up with some way to get out of it. The voice's owner stood behind him, and although the female tone was playful, Ito guessed there was a bit of truth to the 'hole in the throat' statement. Then, another female voice, this one younger, however, rang out from a bit further behind him than the last one. **"The same could be asked of you, miss. Threats of violence on those who may be innocent reflect poorly on you."** Thank goodness. _Someone willing to help,_ the voice in Ito's head said. Slowly, he turned around with his hands in the air, to face the two newcomers.   
  
_Wow._ Both of them were women, attractive ones at that, and Ito guessed them both to be younger than himself, one older than the other though. Ito felt a tinge of embarrassment as he realised he was shirtless; his lean, strong musculature exposed in the moonlight, and his sword, armor, and shirt resting in the stream. "Uh... I-I uh... Hi." _Gosh, Ito,_ he thought, _now's not the time! Think!_  
  
He cleared his throat, then tried to speak again. "Yes. Um... Your question, uh, long story." He moved his right hand up and rubbed the back of his neck. _**How am I supposed to explain being covered in blood?**_ The substance had dried on during his initial exit, spotting his arms, face, equipment, and clothing. "You see, um, well... I was running, and I uh, I got caught in some tripwire." He looked into the eyes of the red head holding the knives, the depression he'd been feeling for years showing in his blue eyes. "I assume that belonged to you? Sorry for... getting caught in it."   
  
Ito felt flustered; His depression-led actions up to this point had limited his interaction with other people to a minimalistic level, almost obsolete in its entirety. Now, he was faced by two women, one of which was likely to injure him if he didn't explain his situation, and he couldn't think of words to say. Looking calm, Ito silently planned his next actions carefully in case things turned south.

Well, there wasn't an immediate explosion of violence, which was nice. She had stepped in fully aware that things might end very badly for her and done it anyways, but Kisaragi wasn't exactly too shy to admit to herself that she was pretty glad she wasn't dead right now. That was the, ah, downside of being a self-aware idiot, sometimes you KNEW you were walking into a possible trap... but had to do it anyways. Honestly, she wasn't sure if that made her brave or stupid... just kidding, it was definitely the second one, but it was nice to pretend to be brave, heh.  
  
All self-congratulatory bullshit aside though, as her eyes adjusted better to the newfound light of the moonlit night, the Sacaen sword ~~waifu~~ woman realized WHY the man was taking a bath in the middle of the friggin' night - it was hard to see the specifics, but it sure as heck looked like he'd taken a bath in a barrel of tomato sauce... thick and sticky tomato sauce... that was blood wasn't it? God dammit. If she hadn't been taught to keep her thoughts to herself except when necessary, Kisaragi would have started swearing then and there, stricken by the thought that it was entirely possible she was 'saving' a mass murderer or something or orphan eater or something equally heinous. In fairness, his stammered greetings and halting explanation didn't exactly sound like the work of a soulless murder hobo, but she wasn't 100% sure.  
  
And why had he been running? Was he fleeing pursuit, and if so, was it for a good deed, or an ill one? Ah the wonders of morality! Sometimes she wished she could just flip a coin to decide whether or not someone needed a boot to the head and a face full of JUSTICE! But in this case she was stuck relying on her head, and while it was pretty tough after a few too many blows to the skull, she wasn't quite as confident in her overwhelming intellect. Going by the armor and weapon, he was probably capable of defending himself at least... but was that a good thing in this case? By the Sky but it would be nice if the good guys and the bad guys were all just labeled for easy recognition. **"...I don't know if I should hope that blood is yours or someone else's."** Kisaragi sighed, the joke sounding pretty flat even to her. She angled her head towards Ito, still keeping an eye on the bandit(?) lady in case she tried anything crazy. **"But at least tell me that it was shed in the name of justice. I don't need to know anything else."**

If anything positive would come out from Asri's numerous experiences flirting with danger, it was her sharp instinct. The sleepiness might have made the thief a bit dull but it didn't stop her from getting alerted by soft footsteps. A man? No, the steps were pretty light. A girl, probably. Shifting her gaze a bit from the naked swordsman, she checked the new guest carefully without showing any immediate reaction. The girl was armed. Nice. Here came another heroic swordsmaster into this crazy night!  
  
Asri said nothing and responded to Kisaragi with a smirk. She let Kisaragi approach Ito, thinking that it would be easier to watch them if they stood close to each other. Still concealing the small knives between her fingers, positioning them so her wrist would hide the weapons, the redhead laughed when Kisaragi mentioned justice. **"Cute swordgirl, you come here, with your sword readied, just because "justice"???"** One of Asri's bad habit was how easy she could laugh off and disrespect other people's belief, especially if they were pretty naive. Justice simply didn't exist in her vocabulary. **"You don't need to make excuse just to flirt with this hot guy,"**she said followed with a wink. **"Why won't you try flirting with me as well? I might like it..."  
**  
By the way, Asri was having hard time averting her eyes from Ito. She couldn't deny that the mysterious man was pretty toned and those blood just added nice sexiness. And she didn't bother to hide her attraction either. The thief simply shamelessly stared at Ito with lustful gaze. **"It's not like I hate a man visiting me at night but you know...I need to keep myself safe. Thankfully my little trap worked well and...you falling was louder than the bell."** Asri was a bit irritated that she needed to repair the tripwire but for reason she was quite pleased with the result. **"I won't pry what you were running from but I pray you didn't bring an angry bear or a horde of undead to my campsite, hmmm? Humor me..."** she asked.  
  
Asri expressions changed when she felt a presence. Although she couldn't be sure where or how many the new guest was, she could somehow sense that someone approaching. There were faint hints, like the rolling pebbles or rustling branches. However, this new guest was very good in concealing his presence, or maybe she was just imagining things? No, there was someone nearby. She was very sure. Still maintaining her relaxed and playful behavior, the thief looked around to see whether her instinct played tricks on her this time or not.

It was unmistakable. That metallic heavy scent that clung faintly to the air. Even if the faint reflections of light conjuring up a visible soft red slickness upon the blonde male's figure hadn't been enough confirmation that there was blood present, the scent would've been all he'd need. It was one he was beyond acquainted with. It was a scent that put him on edge, more so than usual if it was even possible. Fingers tightened their coiled grip around the hilt of his blade and the faintest of metallic _clink_'s faintly fell into the void of night while they conversed in tones of mixed volume. From hushed ones to panicked ones. The girl nearest to Mizuyuki began to speak of the cause to the bloodshed. It's justification through justice.  
  
_Justice_...  
  
Mizuyuki quietly gazed into the dancing tongues of orange and red flame for a moment, deadened eyes fixed but mind adrift amidst thoughts with his glossed over stare traversing thousands of miles and into the endless depths of that small fire. His voice echoing internally into the hanging silence of his mind.  
  
_If blood is shed..in the name of justice.._  
  
  
_Justice...not revenge..but justice._  
  
The red haired woman had shifted to a more sultry tone while addressing the blonde, and it wasn't until she turned to speak to the other girl that Mizuyuki shook from his lament internally. His gaze hardening once more while he slowly straightened his poise silently again. With his un-covered limb crossed over his chest downwards and hand still embracing his katana's hilt, he started to walk forwards now, still cast half in orange and half in shadow from the dancing lights of the red haired females camp site. His low soft spoken tone clearly heard when the fiery haired female finished prying questions once more into the blood laden blonde.  
  
"Blood-shed in the name of justice is the only defensible blood-shed...otherwise it is wrong."  
  
Leaves rustled now beneath his sandals as the Sacaen swordsman stepped closer yet, though his distrust evident in the fact that a fraction of an inch of metal glistened from the reflected light of the campfire. Mizuyuki still heard the distance screams and shouts of fallen family, friends, and neighbors within the distance of his mind even as he spoke of blood-shed. He could still smell the blood. The death. Something not soon forgotten, no doubt. However he'd also hunted quite often. Fresh blood was more poignant. Dried blood, like the kind on parts of his body he'd not yet attempted to wash, gave it textured scent. It also led Mizuyuki to distrust this boy particularly further because he did not elaborate upon the source of it. His gaze fell directly to the boy over the woman's shoulder despite his distance, and his tone asserted this distrust mixed within a near merciless intensity.  
  
"Your bloodstains are not from moments ago. You have slain _something_..or someone. Close proximity, to be adorned in so much. Either you hunt with a blade, were attacked by a beast, or have killed another human. Am I wrong?"   
  
The boy had, to his knowledge, not yet lied. He'd obviously have no way of knowing the validity of his words. Nor was he greatly concerned. But what he did loath was the avoidance. It was almost as bad as lying. To Mizuyuki, a stereotypical Sacaen, this was equally unacceptable.

Ito stood silently, overwhelmed. His face appeared calm as he listened to the bombardment of questions, inwardly praying that he could find some peaceful, calm, un-_oh no he's an evil dude because murder_ way to explain to the two young (and attractive (attracted?)) women that he had killed an entire bandits guild in one night, because years before they'd ended the life of his wife. Then a newcomer approached, dressed somewhat simply (pull down one sleeve and he'd be as dressed as Ito: shirtless), and somehow, unknowingly made it easy for Ito to say it.   
  
_Well,_ Ito thought, _here goes nothing._ "Yes," he replied, taking on a serious tone. "I do hunt with a blade. And, unfortunately, it wasn't for some beast or monster. Years ago, my wife was brutally, mercilessly brought to death by a bandit's guild that had taken control of the small, peaceful village we lived in. The one I was running from when I fell tonight. I was driven into the woods, and couldn't save her. I barely saved myself from the monsters that attacked us in the night. I was rescued by a traveling mercenary group that found me in passing, nursing me back to health as they journeyed from contract to contract. I joined up with them, training and honing my skills until they died in an ambush, again I was the only survivor. That time, though, I was on my own, and decided I was strong enough to return. So I made my way here from the Lycia-Etruria border, building strength and skill until I got back home. Then in one night, tonight, I killed them all. Call it what you want, be it justice, or revenge, but no one would've given those evil men what they deserved, and now that I think about it, I begin to wonder if I was merciful in ending their pitiful lives."   
  
Ito broke the eye contact he'd been holding with the older red haired girl. He could see the attraction in her eyes, and in her posture, and for some odd reason, he didn't want to let her down, or the other girl for that matter. Especially the younger one, whose underlying tone told Ito that she hoped he was good.   
  
He hoped he was, too.

Kisaragi's face wrinkled into a frown at Asri's ridiculous mumblings, disgusted and nonplussed in equal measure. She hadn't thought it was possible to assume much worse than 'bandit' of the unpleasant woman, and yet here she was about to add plenty of harshness within the safety of her own mind; the bandit/thief/strumpet was clearly one of those sorts of loose women that Father had warned her about becoming, with no sense of decorum or modesty - the somewhat straight-laced Sacaen did not find Asri's jokes nearly as funny as the other woman might. Or, well, literally at all. Her sense of humor was apparently VERY different from the thief's.  
  
Her dislike of the woman didn't entirely cloud her judgement though, and while she couldn't see what Asri was doing and didn't even consider the possibility of throwing knives, the woman seemed much, much too calm for facing down and threatening the life of multiple sword users. Either she was some sort of mage, an archer perhaps, or she had friends, and Kisaragi didn't particularly like any of those possibilities. She wasn't AFRAID of Asri per se, and if push came to shove she would do whatever she had to do, but neither was she in the business of throwing her life away for literally nothing, and only a fool would commit suicide by stupidity. If the blonde swordsman was in imminent danger perhaps. But not for nothing.  
  
...Not that he seemed to really need that much protection, if his story was true. She tended to default to trusting people, but it was hard to imagine killing an entire bandit guild... or pointed to him not actually needing much defense from her, heh. She was gonna have to see how good he actually was with a sword if she got a chance. Kind of ironic that Asri thought she wanted a look at his 'sword' when really she just wanted to look at his sword. Sorta funny. Aaaand also a bit disgusting.  
  
**"I'm _nothing_ like you,"** Kisaragi retorted simply to the woman, her voice solid and strong but tinged with distaste that crept into what she had meant to be a neutral tone. In the end, the decision on what to do about Ito had already been made - she hadn't really needed to waste the time thinking about it at all. The pain in his voice was genuine, she was sure of that; it didn't matter if it had been an entire bandit clan or just a small guild or anything in between, she was certain he wasn't lying. And while Kisaragi didn't understand revenge in the way that he or Mizu might, she knew all too well what it was like to have people you cared for taken away from you by the cruel and powerful. Maybe she didn't like his solution that much... but she respected the choice nonetheless.  
  
The decision made, as usual, Kisaragi acted in it without any semblance of restraint or second guessing. **"Hey blondie, you might want to get dressed so we don't 'bother' this nice lady anymore."** She still wasn't sure what the darker skinned swordsman's angle was, but he didn't... seem to be a bad guy, exactly, or an evil one, if his little comment about justice was anything to go by. She kept her hand on the hilt of her undrawn blade nonetheless, not entirely trusting him or Asri, and not particularly fond of staying there regardless. Turning her head to him a little bit, she continued, in a slightly less factual tone. **"Or if you wanna pony up a name, that's fine too."**

The boy had quite the tale. It might have seemed hard to believe by most, but Mizuyuki felt logic ease into his mind even as he slowly extended his blade outwards by fractions of an inch. Fingers still tightly clutching the hilt of his familial weapon with unyielding grasp, even as the blonde haired blood clad man spoke of loss and revenge. He had no reason to lie in these particular aspects. The red haired woman had made it obvious that she personally did not care as to the origin of his blood as much. If he was purely worried for his own safety, he also could have utilized the crimson haired females body as a shield from the blades of the other two who would have been appalled by it.  
  
A few absent seconds passed however, when Mizuyuki let his blade click shut, the metallic clinking sound audible and purposely so to indicate he had opted to trust the boy for now. His palm did not leave his hilt however, and rested atop it while his other hand hung to his side. He then turned his gaze to examine the distanced female who had asked the blonde for a name. She seemed very straightforward. Though different from himself in many discernible ways, he could tell of her origin. That she was Sacaen. It was hard to hide one's origins, after all. Mizuyuki took a few steps forward and while turning his shadow-cast gaze back upon the other male present, his tone when he spoke continued to maintain the neutrality it did before.   
  
"I see. As long as you do not strike down women, children, or the innocent..we have no quarrel..."

Ito's spirit was lifted at the sudden disagreement that had sprouted up between the younger girl and the older one. "**I'm _nothing_ like you!**" _What did she mean by that? Did it have something to do with the older one calling out the girl for flirting with me? She seemed bothered at what I thought was a bit of a reaching joke. I'll never understand women..._  
  
His tone shifting back to a bit more flustered one, his face calm but a bit of redness coming to his cheeks, he spoke again. "Yes, um, anyways. My name's Ito. Ito Kai." He realised the younger girl was basically telling him to get out of here when she told him to get dressed, and the red in his cheeks darkened a bit more as he reached into the stream to grab his shirt. _Great, it's soaked!_ Ito rung the water out as well as he could, the redness in his cheeks leaving just as quickly as the water left his shirt. He slid it over his head, following it with his armor. In some sort of un-Ito-like attempt at showing off, he kicked his sword out of the stream and into the air, grabbing by the hilt, flourishing the blade with a few quick swipes, and sheathing it all in one quick motion. _Might as well show I have more skill with a blade than just slash, slash, stab! Maybe it'll look stylish or something, too._  
  
Ito caught the gaze of the younger girl, his tone changing again; this time from flustered to confident. "What's your name?" He walked around the older red haired girl, doing as the younger one said and 'leaving her alone'. By doing so, he also came closer to the other male in the group. He seemed... experienced. If Ito had to describe his appearance in one word, that would be it. Placing his hands in his pockets in an attempt to set a bit more of a casual air about himself, he subtly studied the appearance of the other male. _Are those **scars**? Yep. Definitely experienced._ As he approached, he made eye contact with the man. "Well, I guess it's my lucky day then. I'm glad I have no quarrel with you, because if I did, I'd likely be torn to pieces by that blade of yours before I could even draw mine from its sheath."

When the mysterious presence finally revealed himself, Asri felt a bit relaxed. The thief saw that the newcomer didn't bear any ill intention toward her so she relaxed her muscles while still keeping watch of him. With Mizuyuki came into the scene now they had 4 persons in this strange place. Really...how could camping in this place for one night make her meet there "colorful" people? Asri snickered as she shook her head in disbelief.  
  
The young swordswoman remark which then followed by another sarcasm only made Asri amused. _"This girl is quite feisty, doesn't she?"_ she thought. To be honest, the crimson-haired thief only cared about the reason why these people approached her camp. Whatever their background might be mattered little to her. **"Well, cutie...you sure you won't regret it?"** she joked again about Ito's state. Kisaragi had shown clear lack of interest to the blonde swordsman but Asri didn't consider to stop teasing her, not even a bit. Lets just hope she wouldn't get stabbed later. Her attention switched to Ito and whistled when the man did a nice stunt with his sword. Was he showing off?  
  
Asri yawned. Ito told them his story about taking revenge against some bandits. That was a quite touching story but it clearly wasn't something that would interest Asri. Ignoring how the other two offered sincere comments about Ito's story, Asri finally put her small knives into the leather sheaths strapped around her left thigh. **"So..."** she spoke to them, eyes on Kisaragi. **"...it seems a minute ago we were on the edge of killing each other? How nice we are so chummy right now. I hate fighting..."** To be fair, Asri was the one who had initiated the hostile situation when she had thrown threats to ito so it wasn't really her place to protest. Among all these people, Asri might be the only one who took the situation lightly. Sure the trickster wasn't lowering her guard too much but she acted like she didn't care.  
  
**"Geez...now I am surrounded by heroic warriors from Sacae who talk about justice a lot. I wonder if I should mark today as a special day..."** Asri remarked while hinting that she was aware that Mizuyuki and Kisaragi were Sacaens. She might have thrown a rude comment casually. It was interesting how those two reacted to it. Asri then walked to the dying campfire and threw some dry weeds and combustible things like papers and leafs into it. Adding a little heat to this cold night would be nice, the others might appreciate it too. **"I like how a man says he doesn't want women get hurt. Maybe you can guard me tonight, Mr warrior?"** she spoke to Mizuyuki, throwing flirtatious wink.  
  
**"Oh, and before any of you ask...you can all me Asri..."** she added.

This had gone from perfectly normal rescue into some... weird... weirdness. Kisaragi didn't really have words for whatever the heck this had devolved into. On the bright side, this Ito guy didn't seem completely insane, evil, or insanely evil for that matter. And Mr. tall dark and nameless was... not killing them all. So that was good. Neither was the bandit witch, though the little Sacaen could think of some other words rhyming with witch that would apply just as well if not better. At this point she was starting to realize that these people were either going to give her a headache or a reason to snap, go evil, and kill everyone in Elibe. Kisaragi wasn't sure which was actually more appealing at this point, which worried her.  
  
On the bright side though, the redhead lady seemed to have decided to calm her ti- she had calmed down was the point. And Ito, as was the way of strapping young men with more bravado than brains, seemed interested in her. Kisaragi privately suspected that his 'interested' had something to do with hormones, something she wanted little to nothing to do with at this point. She couldn't actually read Asri worth jack to be sure if it wasn't some femme fatale, rip his head off with your legs after mating black widow kinda thing, or just them both being flirty idiots. Probably a little of both, but at this point Ito seemed to be back on his feet and thus not really her responsibility anymore. If he wanted to risk life and limb in the pursuit of currency while disregarding females, or vice versa, it was his life. She just hadn't wanted to see an innocent(?) man get murdered.  
  
He did have a nice little flourish with that sword of his thought. Kisaragi was normally decently observant, but she noted that in particular above most of the other details of the clearing. If she ran into him at some point NOT half dead, naked, and exhausted, she was going to politely request a sparri-haha just kidding she was going to f**k**g come at him without any semblance of choice on his part. No point in wasting a good opportunity to get yourself killed, she always said!  
  
That said, whether out of immaturity or decency, the obvious flirting did bother the teenager a little. She wasn't sure why and THAT bothered her too, but regardless she didn't really want to watch, and the slight expression of distaste curling her lips might give it away to a careful observer, even in the dim of the flickering fire. If they had been people around her own age, or a little less... distasteful in general, she might have been a little more interested - but Kisaragi was already exhausted coming off of a LONG day, had only been out training out of discipline rather than desire, and didn't particularly care for any of them at this point. Eh. Maybe blondie. He didn't seem that bad. But the edgy guy sure wasn't much of a people person and the redhead... the less said, the better.  
  
Finally taking her hand off the hilt of her blade, Kisaragi crossed her hands and frowned. It was probably good that she hadn't been trying to look intimidating because the pose was about the exact opposite of it. She didn't trust any of them, but letting her guard down a little didn't seem like the end of the world. **"Well, good luck Ito. And, uh... other guy,"** she added, completely unsure of how to address Mizu and not particularly caring either way. Dude obviously had some issues that she wanted nothing to do with, probably lost his parents to bandits as a child or some crap. **"Think my job here is done."**

**"Look...I love our bonding bonding moment and seriously the sight of you men have been very...pleasant."** Asri raised both hands to get attention and laughed. **"But I honestly need sleep. And I see you guys kinda make it very awkward to continue our conversation. So I am just gonna back to my tent..."** Before she continued, the thief winked to both men and even the leaving Kisaragi. **"...with or without you,"** she ended.  
  
Although normally Asri would like to talk with these strangers just for the sake of getting rid of boredom, the atmosphere had been a little stranger. Kisaragi probably didn't like her and those two men hadn't really shown interest for more relaxed conversation after all. This talk about justice and all simply wasn't Asri's cup of tea, she got bored. Maybe she could have break the strange atmosphere like she usually did, the crimson-haired thief was always good with that. But no. Not tonight, at least.   
  
**"Alright boys. You can continue your...flirting with each other but when you are done please leave. However, if you want to join in my tent please ask nicely. I can't guarantee your safety if you try to sneak in or something,"** she said, laughing. Of course she didn't really expect them to accept her random invitation. They didn't look like lechery guys after all but who knows.   
  
Turning around gracefully on purpose, Asri headed back to her tent while stretching her numb arms. A small tears dropped to her cheek when she yawned. She looked at the others for the last time and smirked before finally returning to her tent and sleep.

### Similar Journey; Disparate Destination
Ravvus sucked down a gulp of air, taking time to fill his gut as much as possible. He exhaled, allowing just as much time for the oxygen to leave his body. The mage's breathing was measured, well-paced. His eyes were calm and focused. His face steely and composed, but his twitching arm belied such signs of tranquility.  
  
He'd been in these woods for some time now. Ravvus liked the woods. He felt the presence of the spirits of anima stronger there than in any other place. The woods were a conducive place to practice magic, a good place to focus and draw on the powers of nature. It was by far the second greatest artifice Ravvus had when it came to casting magic. The first, of course, was his Trinity tome.  
  
But Ravvus had a fiery temper. A temper which made the boon of the forest all but moot. He'd been there for some time now, trying to summon the storms of Trinity. The words of Mimi echoed in his head. Words of advice and encouragement. Ravvus had to discover his own means of summoning wind spells. But all attempts so far had proven utter failures. It really pissed him off. And his patience was all but gone.  
  
The mage's arm twitched.  
  
Being calm, maintaining composure amidst failure. These are not easy things for Ravvus to do. When Ravvus fails at a task, he gets angry. And that anger compounds itself until it has been properly vented. Ravvus lifted his right hand, his fingers stiff and curled inwards. A fireball the size of his head, materialized above the mage's hand. Drawing back rapidly, Ravvus flung the fireball forward and watched with immense satisfaction as the projectile exploded against the bark of a nearby tree.

Walking as quickly as he could, Ito traversed the lands of Etruria with cautious anxiety. He despised the place, after all they had magically nuked Ostia, his late wife's hometown and the head power in the Lycian Alliance, and they had murdered the group of mercenaries that took him in and treated him like family. All in cold blood. Ito's feelings for the place, however nice it may be, were not good. Speeding along through the trees, with his hand on the hilt of his sword in a passive aggressive manner, Ito was on high alert. Then suddenly, the tree four meters to his left exploded violently, showering him in bark, wood splinters, and... sparks?   
  
Ito turned in the tree's direction, unsheathing his sword and putting himself in a guard-like stance, all in one motion. He saw in front of him a young man dressed in leather armor, covered by a horrifically colored orange cloak. The person looked angry. Like, _really angry_. Was he a mage? Ito could only guess as he called out, appearing calm but taking up an aggressive undertone. "Hey! What was that for?" Then, almost unconsciously, Ito added, "You Etrurians seem bent on my destruction! Come at me!"  
  
Ito would play this out aggressively, reacting to his new opponent's first move. He would wait for an opening, then carry his advantage as far as he could before getting to a safe space again. Ito was beginning to open up his emotions, letting the negative feelings he'd had over the last few years fuel a very passionate approach to combat.

The blast was spectacular. The bark crumpled and blackened as the fireball collided against the tree's frame. The sparks showered about the ground in a fleeting dance. Smoke trailed from the smoldering wood, permeating the atmosphere with a thick odor. But such a display of force was hardly enough to curb the mage's ire. Fortunately, for Ravvus, the woods were feeling merciful, or perhaps simply wished not to be incinerated, and presented another means of stoking his flames.  
  
A boy, blond of hair, and draped in gold-trimmed finery appeared behind the smoking tree. Ravvus hadn't even seen him approach. Not too surprising given the mage's volatile state. **”What!?”** The mage snarled, his tone wavering between furious and embarrassed. He had not anticipated someone spying on his temper tantrum.  
  
**”How long have you been there?”** The mage inquired with another scathing snarl.  
  
The boy's response didn't matter. His combat stance told Ravvus everything he wanted to know. **”Oh-”** Ravvus interrupted, the corners of his lips curling into a mischievous smile. **”You're looking for a fight, then, are you?”** Ravvus brought his hands to his waist, both palms facing upwards. Fireballs came into being above each hand and the mage slowly advanced upon the swordsman. **”I'd be happy to oblige you.”** Something was off about this young man. He had the clothing of a nobleman and had mentioned something about being persecuted by Etrurians. Perhaps he was a high class citizen of some foreign kingdom, like Bern or Vinland, and been forced out by the Prophet's crusaders. If Ravvus were of a more composed mind, he might inquire more of this 'Prince of Vinland'. But the mage was not.  
  
When the mage had closed about a third of the gap between him and Ito, he hunched down and brought the fireballs together. The combustion engines combined to form an even greater entity and the mage drew both hands away from the blazing creation. Two whips of flame followed the mage's hands as they withdrew from the large fireball. The whips curled and stiffened, giving the fireball the appearance of a glaive.  
  
**”Lets! Go!”** The mage shouted, and hurled the spinning spell. The glaive went vertical, its' whips of flames slapping the earth and leaving a singed trail with each rotation.

Ito presently ignored the magic boy's questions, less focused on answering and more focused on preparing himself. His pent up emotions held control of the myrmidon now, and Ito sought for only one thing. _Justice,_ fueled by his mistrust, disliking of and general hatred for Etrurians, because of hat they'd done to him in the past.   
  
**"Lets! Go!"** At the moment the foolishly dressed mage -it was confirmed by the spinning body of fire the boy controlled- shouted out, Ito dashed forward and pushed off, landing clear of the fireball's path. Free from the distraction of an immediate threat, he continued his charge, coming within a couple meters of the mage and swinging his sword from his lower right side in a diagonal slash, sweeping the blade upwards and to Ito's left side. Fueled by a buildup of emotion that had been in creation for literal years, Ito yelled out angrily as he made the strike. If this strike was successful, it would end the fight with an injured, foolishly dressed mage, with Ito on his way.   
  
That was unlikely to be the case, however, so Ito made mental preparations for what he would do next. Today, the myrmidon would go in hard and fast, a passionate hatred fueling his power and speed, accompanied by an already powerful physical strength that was coupled with impressive natural speed. Ito's next movements depended on his enemy's next moves, and would be fluid, precise, and natural. Years of training, hunting, and surviving all built up to each careful move Ito made in combat, be it with monsters, or with men.

The earth pounding engine of fire zoomed forward as Ito leapt clear of its' path. The inexorable entity continued onward, crashing into a tree with a cacophonous explosion. With its' base all but incinerated, the tree toppled to the earth with a rustle of leaves and the groaning of wood.  
  
**”Haha!”** Ravvus cackled as the Prince of Vinland avoided the spinning glaive with relative ease. The young man was certainly quick to respond. Judging by the lightness of his feet and the slimness of his sword, Ravvus surmised the man might have had some training with a Sacaen tribe. Their kind had a particular fondness for quick footing and quicker blades. What was more intriguing was the young man's fearlessness. Ravvus had expected his initial attack to have had some effect on a psychological level. That glaive was bigger than most spells the mage could summon. The mere sight of it was intimidating, to say the least. But not to this blonde youth. Either the man knew no fear or had faced similarly daunting challenges in the past. The mage was impressed.  
  
As the youth drew close, Ravvus kept his eyes trained on his opponent's blade. The mage knew if he let the swordsman get in close, and stay close, the fight would be over. Ravvus too was light on his feet, but multi-tasking between avoiding slashes, muttering incantations, and occupying one hand with Trinity, were a bit too much for him to handle. If there was any hope for the mage to reset, he would need to trade blows with the youth. As the Prince of Vinland readied his attack, Ravvus pivoted, obscuring his right hand. With his hidden hand, Ravvus mustered a fireball. With the other, he withdrew the Trinity tome.  
  
The mage leapt back as the opposing blonde swung his sword. It was all Ravvus could do to avoid the diagonal strike. Landing lightly, Ravvus gave the youth his answer, whipping his right arm forth and sending the fireball careening towards the opponent. As the mage allowed himself to reset, he reached for the clasp on his orange cloak. Undoing it, Ravvus allowed his attire to fall to the earth, revealing a light set of leather armor underneath. **”Not bad, kid. You're pretty fast, not to mention ballsy. Where'd you learn how to fight?”**

Ito quieted his yell, the mage boy jumping back and narrowly avoiding Ito's first strike. Through his emotion, he was blind to the fireball, but instinct taught him that something was coming right then. Ducking as magic boy hurled another, albeit smaller fireball, it passed right over his head and hit the hard ground behind him, leaving a patch of charred grass a few meters behind Ito. As the magic man was reaching up to unclasp his horrifically colored cloak, Ito swung again, taking another step to put Ravvus back in striking distance. Using a tight, two handed grip this time to add some extra power to the strike. Ito's rapid forward advances would keep Ravvus on his toes and unable to fully retaliate, Ito guessing from the smaller size of the last fireball that magic boy threw that reciting spells while running away was difficult, to say the least. So, he planned on keeping it that way, and not allowing the mage he could nominate for 'worst dressed combatant' any breathing room would keep the advantage in his possession.  
  
As Ito attacked, the young mage spoke in a rather cocky manner, asking Ito where he learned to fight. _Well,_ he thought, _I might as well tell him. It won't do him any good anyways._ "Thanks. You're not bad yourself, and if I didn't want to hit you I might've flinched. I've been training with swordsmen since I was a little kid, and with a more experienced mercenary group before you Etrurians slaughtered them like wolves devour helpless lambs."

**”Have you?”** Ravvus inquired as he leapt backward, feeling the end of Ito's blade scrape across his leather armor. The youth had caught him off guard. Ravvus winced, having barely avoided a direct hit. He'd anticipated having more time to reset, but it appeared nothing short of a direct blow would deter his swift opponent's advance. **”Funny, I've been fighting since I was a boy too. Just not with any weapons.**  
  
The gears in the mage's head turned, formulating a plan to wear down the ferocious swordsman. The Prince of Vinland's fighting style was fast, relentless, and lethal. An effective strategy, so long as it managed to dispatch quickly dispatch the opponent. If it didn't, the fighter would find themselves exhausted fairly quickly. Ravvus was confident in his abilities to avoid, or receive only glancing blows, so long as he kept his distance. But he would have been more confident with a quarterstaff, or some other means of deflecting incoming attacks. The mage had small intention of gambling on his nimble reflexes alone. He'd win this fight through a balance of magic and reflexes.  
  
Whatever the case, Ravvus needed to take back the momentum now and that required a risk. **”Any of these folks you trained with happen to be Sacaen?”** Ravvus inquired, his eyes lingering on the smoldering remains of his initial spell. Between conversing the mage recited incantations from Trinity and found his free hand alight with a fan of fire. Breaking forward, towards both his opponent and the tree the glaive had struck, the mage reached out with his spell-wielding hand and cast an arc of orange heat. **”Your style seems like something adopted from the plainsmen.”**

Magic boy jumped back and responded, his claims of training since childhood drawing a similarity to the swordsman. However, mage man couldn't jump back far enough this time, and the moment Ito felt his blade connect to the center of the magic boy's chest he released the hilt with his left hand and pushed forward in another long step ahead with his original one handed grip. The tip of his blade was driven forward with a new, powerful momentum that was very likely to penetrate the simple leather magic boy wore. Hopefully this would end it, so he could continue on his way. While he was unsure of where his way would be, the only thing Ito knew was that it was forward.   
  
His push forward would interrupt anything mage man would attempt to say after his initial question about Ito's training roots, banter and incantations alike. Less than a meter from the boy now, Ito threw a punch with his left hand, an uppercut to magic boy's lower parts. Even through leather, this would likely hurt a lot, at least if magic boy was human. "I've never trained with Sacaens before. But there was a swordmaster that I trained with. He was a bit more on the calm side, but he could be more aggressive than anyone when he needed to be. He showed me much, and would've shown me more had your people not killed him in cold blood!"  
  
Ito did not intend to kill magic boy, but he did intend to win.

The young man, ferocious as ever, pressed his attack. With one swift motion, the blonde charged forward, attempting to stab Ravvus. The mage was ready this time, growing more comfortable with his opponent's fighting style. With one foot Ravvus pivoted out of the way, narrowly avoiding the blade which was only inches from his body. The conjurer was more than a little incensed by that. He'd been coming to enjoy this little brawl with the Prince, but the boy had just gone for a potentially lethal blow. Ravvus didn't take kindly to his life being threatened. Muttering a minor spell into existence, Ravvus felt a wreath of flames envelop his free hand. His opponent was close now. Ravvus would lock with him and make the Prince release his sword.  
  
Ravvus went to grapple with his opponent only to notice the Prince of Vinland 's low striking fist. The mage's eyes widened as he realized what the swordsman was going to do. **”Heh. Despicable.”** Ravvus was abruptly cut off as Ito's fist made contact. The mage winced in pain, feeling his thighs close together. He paused for a moment, allowing his body to comprehend what had just happened. **”Your-”** Ravvus coughed, interrupting himself. **”Mistake was assuming I'm an Etrurian.”**With great swiftness the mage gripped the swordsman's wrist, flames lapping about his opponent's sword hand. **”I'm not some school-bred pansy who can't take a low blow.”** Indeed, growing up amongst delinquents had hardened the mage's... pain tolerance. Ravvus reared his head back, preparing to slam his skull against the Prince's. **”I grew up in the Western Isles. I was born fighting dirty!”** The mage thrust his head forward, embracing the thrill of combat and abandoning all pretense of strategy or planning.

Ito smirked, his punch successful. Although the thrust missed, he hit with his second attack. The magic boy grabbed Ito's wrist, the fire around magic boy's hand creating a heat that went through Ito's thick, long sleeve. The grab burned him, but he tried to ignore it as the mage man spoke. Ito's eyes widened. _Have I made a mistake?_ he thought, regretting his instinctually quick jump to combat at their first moments of encountering each other. _Too late now..._  
  
Mage boy said something about knowing how to fight dirty, and as he pulled his head back for a headbutt Ito took advantage, throwing another punch; this time aimed at magic boy's throat. This would hurt, and likely make it hard for the mage man to breathe. Hopefully, it would also lead to the grab being broken.  
  
Ito looked into magic boy's eyes, a sudden appearance of calm replacing his expression of aggression. "I have no need to fight with you, then. We have no valid quarrel to battle for. No reason to fight each other." Although it hurt, he had to say it. There was absolutely no reason for mage man to get hurt, he wasn't Etrurian. Ito had jumped to conclusions, he'd let his pent up emotions take over. _Next time,_ Ito thought, _I can't let this happen. One day I might get burned..._ He remembered the feeling in his right wrist, _burned worse than this, anyways._ If Ito successfully broke the grab, he would sheath his sword and step back, to face his opponent in a less aggressive nature.

There was little the mage could do as Ito countered the incoming headbutt. The well-dressed opponent pushed Ravvus' Adam's apple inwards, forcing the air out of his lungs. The mage's eyes bugged out, his attack abruptly stopped. Ravvus leapt back, breaking his lock with Ito, panting and wheezing for air. As the mage slid backwards, he pressed his still flaming hand on the grass, leaving a trail of of embers in his wake. Eyes trained on the Prince, Ravvus extinguished the flames in his free hand and placed an open palm on his bruised neck.  
  
**”Hurrrr...”** Ravvus took labored breaths in between coughs. **”Huuuuu-”** It felt like a someone had jammed a rock in his throat, making it almost impossible for air to pass in and out of his lungs. The mage slammed his fist into the ground. **”No -hack- need to fight me?! No _valid_ quarrel!? Because of what? Because I fight dirty? Because you're a little scared now that you've felt my flames?”** The mage leveled Trinity in one hand, bringing the book to eye level. **”You tried to stab me in the chest! You punched my testicles!”**Ravvus removed his hand from his throat, his fingers curled into a tense fist. **”Even I don't fight dirty enough to go for the gonads- most of the time!”**The mage bent over, a fit of coughing overtook him after the last outburst. **”Hurrr...”** Ravvus stared the swordsman in the eye, the embers on the ground flared with life. **”If you don't want to fight anymore, than you'd better start running.”** The mage spoke in between incantations. **”Because I'm just getting warmed up.”** Ravvus' free hand shot up, the embers transformed into earnest flames and an arc of heat jumped towards the Prince.

Ito stared at the magic boy as he fell to the ground, magic boy's mystical ember trail glowing and smoking as it singed the once green grass. Ito felt bad; He'd started it, even though mage boy threw the first attack. now, as magic man sat on the ground caught up in a coughing fit, Ito began to turn away. Then, magic boy spoke. Ito stopped and looked at mage boy, making eye contact once more as magic boy sounded quite enraged. Magic boy pointed out Ito's carefully placed killing blows, which the magic boy had only narrowly avoided, and each time Ito opened his mouth to apologise, he was cut off by another coughing fit and more verbal attacks.   
  
Magic boy recommended Ito run, but Ito wasn't going to run. He was going to leave calmly, as if to shrug off his mistake of presuming a fight with the magic boy as if it were nothing. His face was calm, but mage boy would be able to recognise what Ito felt through his eyes. Regret. Ito's actions would not have been acceptable, had he still had his team around. Had they not been slain by the Etrurians, Ito might not have ever harbored any resentment towards the nation. Of course, he couldn't go around blaming people for why he did things. After all, it was his choices that mattered, not what anyone else decided to do to him. Jumping into a fight with no explanation or knowledge beforehand of who he was facing, all because he made the assumption that mage boy was Etrurian, was completely against what Ito should stand for. _Stupid._  
  
_You know it. I know it. I messed up. Not because I'm weak, but because I jumped to conclusions. I didn't think, and I don't blame you for trying to defend yourself. I'm no good at this... But if I don't keep going... How will I learn?_  
  
Ito's unspoken thoughts were interrupted as magic boy hurled more fire at the swordsman. Ito sidestepped the rage-filled outburst, then turned and walked away, leaving magic boy to sit in his anger. _It's fine with me if he holds a grudge; it's not like there is anything I can do about it anyways.  
  
  
  
*I just hope he knows, I'm sorry.*

The mage stared down his opponent as the swordsman registered Ravvus' words. The Prince maintained a look of serenity layered beneath something Ravvus had a hard time deciphering. It looked to him like the Prince was sad. And then, to Ravvus' utter disbelief, the swordsman side-stepped the incoming attack and turned his back on the mage. Ravvus was used to the boy evading his attacks but turning his back was something utterly new. New and insulting. **”You- You aren't serious!”** The mage blurted out, but the nimble fighter kept walking. He offered Ravvus no response, keeping any unstated reasons for ending the fight to himself.  
  
**”You- Are you trying to _mock_ me?!”** The mage conjured a wild and unstable fireball in his free hand. The entity quickly spurted tentacles and rapidly lost it's orb-like shape. **”Who turns their back in the middle of a fight?!”** Ravvus threw the volatile flame at his pacifistic opponent. The spell flew past Ito, just inches from grazing his head. **”STAND AND FIGHT!”** Ravvus bellowed, summoning and hurling another warning spell just short of his opponent.  
  
The Prince of Vinland kept walking.  
  
Teeth grinding against each other, eyes wide with madness, and hand clamped hard on Trinity's spine, Ravvus nearly frothed at the site of Ito. The mage slammed his free hand down upon the pages of Trinity, flipping through the tome of spells with reckless abandon. He came to a page containing incantations for a spell called 'lightning'. The culmination of novice thunder spells, lightning cast out an arc of electricity which struck, pierced, and even looked, like a spear. Albiet, a jagged, ivory spear. Ravvus began to mutter the incantations for the spell. **”This is your last warning, prince.”** The mage moved his free hand from the tome, opening it so that his fingers looked a 'C' lying on its' back. **”Finish this fight, facing me, or I will strike you down as you walk away.”** Audible pops and cracks could be heard as a jagged, white spear appeared in the conjurer's hand.

Ito looked back at his former opponent at his final outburst. Making eye contact, he spoke softly, but in an assertive tone that was still loud enough for Ravvus to hear clearly. "I'm not turning my back in the middle of a fight. This fight. Is _over._" Turning again, Ito kept walking, placing his right hand on the hilt of his sheathed sword as he entered the tree line.   
  
Hopefully the mage boy would understand that Ito didn't want to fight with him anymore. Ito wondered if he fought too much in his life. Was such a thing possible, when the only thing he could do in his life was wander around, fighting for the people of his location, or for the people of his past? Maybe Ito wasn't ready... Maybe he should go back to Lycia, until he could get things figured out. _Yes,_ Ito thought, _that is what I will do._  
  
Protected from magic boy by the trees now, Ito continued on walking, turning towards the direction he came from. The journey home would be long, but he made up his mind. He would get back to Lycia, keep building his strength, and maybe be fortunate enough to make some acquaintances that weren't through combat. He could only hope for the best as he pressed forward.   
  
_Should I not have been on my way to the Western Isles? Perhaps I made a mistake? Yes, I'm sure of it. If only I'd thought first... Perhaps I could've avoided this encounter completely...  
  
_At least I didn't kill the poor boy._

The foreigner didn't even flinch. He saw the lightning spear in Ravvus' hand and heard every word the mage spoke. None of it affected him. The swordsman was either confident enough or foolish enough to ignore the threats. **”What?!”** Ravvus bellowed. **”You can't do that! Fights don't finish until one person claims irrefutable victory!”** The Prince kept walking. **”Get back here!”** No response. **”I. Said.”** Ravvus growled, tightening his grip on the lightning lance. Singes and black spots appeared on the mage's hand. Without additional protection, Ravvus' resistance to anima was not enough to protect him from directly touching the spell. **”GET BACK HERE!!”** The mage threw his spell forward as Ito disappeared into the woods. The lightning spear crashed into one of the many trees of the woods, splitting an aperture wide open with an explosion of splinters and light.  
  
The Prince was gone.  
  
**”Fine! Run with your tail between your legs, then.”**The mage shouted, his voice becoming hoarse. He was unsure of whether the swordsman could even still hear him. **”Just know that this battle ended with my victory, with my-”** Ravvus cut himself off. Why was he so angry? The conjurer looked about his surroundings, now noticing the damage caused by his spells. A total of three trees were either obliterated or scarred by the mage's magic. Patches of grass roared with fire, the due's of dodged fireballs and other inaccurate spells. **”Huff, huff.”** Ravvus panted, realizing now that he was out of breath. The mage brought his free hand to eye level. There we black spots on the palm of his hand and the inside of his fingers. Otherwise the skin looked shiny, new. Those were places where the skin had peeled under intense heat. Ravvus then brought Trinity to eye level, flipping to the pages containing incantations for wind magic. All of this rage. All of this destruction because he couldn't cast a simple 'breeze' spell.  
  
The mage exhaled, tired.  
  
Ravvus flipped back to pages on fire magic. With a free hand, he moved about the forest collecting flame from where-ever it burnt. The conjurer called upon the fire on the grass and the flames in the trees, gathering all of the magic into a single, sizable fireball. The mage maintained his spell, watching the fireball dance and fizzle until it dwindled into nothing. And when there was nothing left, Ravvus left the woods and returned to Delfia.
