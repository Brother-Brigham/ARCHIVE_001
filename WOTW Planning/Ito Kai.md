## **Backstory**
Name: Ito Kai  
  
Class: Myrmidon  
  
Age: 24  
  
Born in: Caelin, Lycia  
  
Appearance: Standing at 5'10" and weighing in at 175 lbs, Ito's expression is shown only through calm. If eyes truly are the windows to the soul, Ito's brightly colored blue eyes are the only way to determine his feelings. The wildly messy blonde hair Ito sports hints at his style, while his lean, muscular build shows great strength and confidence. His movements show care and finesse, especially in each move he makes in combat.  
  
Personality: Once energetic and uncontainably bright in emotion, Ito has buried those emotions deep inside himself. The tremendous amount of grief he's felt in his life stills haunts him, and he's kept all the pain bottled up for years. Ito only expresses this pain in combat, using the raw emotion to fuel his aggressive combat style. When not in combat, Ito retains a very calm and collected manner, never reacting harshly to anything. The small things Ito does hint at a kind, caring side to him, but because of his familial losses he is much more subtle about it. Since his loss, Ito has gained an extreme hero complex, which could also be perceived as a type of death wish.  
  
Story: Although he hails from a smaller part of Lycia, Ito was in no way raised poorly. His family worked very closely with one of Caelin's military leaders, and as such Ito received one of the best educations available at the time. Unfortunately this was in the midst of war, so his main focus was learning how to survive. He always had some type of sword with him, ranging from the wooden practice swords to the iron sword his father owned. While on a trip to Ostia (before its destruction), Ito met a young lady and they quickly bonded, becoming fast friends and young lovers. Once they were both old enough, they were married and settled, but because bandits, monsters, and war had gotten much worse, it was no longer safe to live where they were. One night their small village was attacked by bandits, who heavily wounded some and killed many. Those who were heavily wounded and tried to escape were devoured by monsters and included Ito's wife, who was unable to survive even with Ito's best help. As his wife died, Ito did his best to fend off the monsters that attacked him, before he fell due to blood loss. Thankfully, Ito was saved by a small band of mercenaries that had a healer in their group. They couldn't do anything to save his wife however, as she had painfully died before Ito could fend off the monsters attacking her. Because he was grateful and needed to recover, Ito joined the group that saved him. For a while, Ito was somewhat happy, still able to express himself and feel joy because of the kindness of his new friends. While traveling near Etruria, however, they were mistaken for a Lycian scouting party, and were slaughtered without reason. Once again, Ito was the only one to survive, but this time because he had ran in fear. From this point on, the emotional pain was too much, and Ito suddenly felt like the only thing to do now in memory of his team and wife, was to be someone's hero. He wouldn't run anymore. He would use the training from his youth and from the time he spent as a mercenary to benefit him in rescuing people.  
  
It started out small, with the silent liberation of several small hamlets from bandit groups and monsters as he slowly made his way back to his home village, building his strength and skill. Eventually he got to the place he used to call home, which was now overrun by a decently sized group of bandits. The bandits had gotten lazy in the years since they took over, as they felt invincible in their homemade "fortress" in the village center. Ito snuck in one night, silently and quickly executing a large number of careless, drunk men that had once killed his family and friends. He made his way through the place and found their leader, who he challenged to a duel. The drunken bandit "king" was unable to keep up with Ito's speed and fluidity in motion, and was quickly eviscerated and killed. Ito, now finished with what he came to do, left under the cover of the remaining darkness and began his search for someone to save, a fear in the back of his mind that he wouldn't be able to live up to his emotional need to do so.

## **Character Journal (Thread Log)**
### Escape!
Ito’s night had been a rush. He had basically slaughtered an entire bandit’s guild, all in the name of “justice”. Was he mistaken? Had he gone about it all wrong? That couldn’t be… It was the bandits’ fault he’d lost his wife. The Etrurians had taken the lives of his former saviors. Ito wanted so very badly to get them next, but he needed time. Time to train, time to save, and time to kill. This would be his mission, to save innocents and deal evil to evil. Death to the murderers, the corrupt, and the monsters, both human and not.   
  
Although he’d been successful in his original task, he had to get out. Those he left alive would find him, if he didn’t leave now. Ito rushed through the small building, right hand on the hilt of his sheathed sword. His exit was as quick as his entrance, albeit less bloody and a lot quieter. His footsteps near silent, Ito used the dark of night to his advantage, and it seemed as though the darkness was willing to comply. This man who had murdered for justice would not be found guilty, nor likely found as he fled. He’d build his strength, and take on the rest of his opponents head-on in due time. All in due time…  
  
As Ito fled his former hometown, he hastily hopped over rocks and ran between the trees that trembled in the wind. If anyone were to find him now, they’d have to be watching carefully. His raiment stained by blood, Ito would definitely seem suspicious to anyone in their right mind, but who in their right mind would be out in the woods late into the night?

Asri hadn't changed her plan to look for opportunity in Etruria. The Elimine country was probably the strongest in this continent right now so it had highest probability to offer good job and safety. Bad luck came for her this time, unfortunately. Her trip through Caelin was delayed by the landslide that made the main road unusable. It was too late to reach a city like she had planned because the night had already descended. In the end, she was forced to spend the night in the forest. However, someone experienced with mobile and fast-paced lifestylle like Asri wouldn't be caught unprepared by this little obstacle.  
  
Before it became too dark, Asri had completed a simple camp with a tent and a firepit in a clearing next to the stream. Her horse was tied to nearby tree and the strong stallion had already slept, feeling tired after the long trip. As cautious as ever, the redhead had prepared safety measures against unwanted guests like wild animals or bandits. A thin and almost invisible string surrounded her camp, attached to the wood sticks that she had planted to the ground. In the middle of each line she had put small bells so if for some reason the string was pulled, stretched, or touched by someone or something, the bells would act like an alarm. Of course it wouldn't make loud sound but even a faint ring would be enough to tell Asri that someone had entered the perimeter. And as if it wasn't enough, Asri's self-made smoke bomb was attached to the entrance of the tent with a little modification that would make it explode if someone tried to enter the tent.   
  
Asri herself was sleeping comfortably in her bedroll and wrapped herself in blanket. The thief's cloak and leather vest were folded neatly and placed next to the bedroll along with her knives and short sword. A smile in her face showed that she was having a nice dream and good sleep.

After his initial escape, Ito's pace had slowed from a sprint to a jog. _Almost there,_ he thought, _then I'll be home free._ If he could remember correctly, there was a stream up ahead; that would be his destination. Running forward, Ito suddenly smelled what he thought was... smoke? Ito couldn't see far in front of him, but in the dark it would've been easy to make out a camp fire. However, he couldn't distinguish any light from one, so he kept going the same direction. Ito tripled his running pace; he could hear the stream now. The running water was close, and Ito planned to use it to wash the blood from his sword, armour, and clothing. _Almost there...  
  
**WHAM!**_ Ito gasped for breath, his impact with the ground knocking the air from his lungs. Was that a tripwire? In Ito's shocked mind it could very well have been anything from that to a magical force bent on his destruction. His senses came back to him, and he realized his ankle was caught. _So it was a tripwire..._ As Ito tried to get free, he heard the soft jingling of bells. He sat up, unwrapped the wire from his ankle and stood, desperately hoping the obnoxiously loud thud that accompanied his fall along with the bells wouldn't wake whoever set this trap, or anyone else in the area for that matter.  
  
As Ito looked around, he could see a basic camp, set up right next to the stream. He carefully unsheathed his sword and approached the stream, wiping the blood away as quickly and quietly as he could in the running water. Next would come his paldron and chestplate, so long as nobody caught him...

Alright, that was a very loud alarm...  
  
Asri opened her eyes slowly. She hasn't been fully awake yet but that sound washed away most of her sleepiness. Making sure she didn't make unnecessary movement, the redhead tried to slide into the edge of the tent as quiet as possible. Something had invaded her campsite, could be a human or a wild bear. Asri was calm. She was already holding her dagger as she observed the entrance of the tent. Whatever outside might be a threat for her, it wouldn't hurt to be cautious.   
  
A minute passed, no one hadn't tried to enter the tent so far. Even if the intruder tried it, he would trigger the smoke bomb by her. Asri could hear faint sound out there but it was too vague for her to gain any information about the intruder. So, the thief carefully crawled to the exit after hastily wearing her leather vest, quickly disabled her own trap, and came outside with her dagger in hand. "Can't I have a good sleep? I am very worn out after the trip..." she thought, protesting for her disturbed sleep. For someone who had gotten unwanted guest, Asri looked pretty calm. In fact, she didn't seem to take it seriously. Her blue eyes examined the area, looking for anything or anyone that had caused that loud sound.  
  
And there he was...next to the stream doing some laundry... The intruder turned out to be a young man, maybe around Asri's age, and he seemed to be busy cleaning his equipment. Could it be that he came here by coincidence? Maybe he accidentally triggered the alarm. Well, such thing wasn't unlikely. Not everyone out there wanted to harm her so there was no need to become paranoid. Still, it was wise to make sure of his intention first and the red-haired thief was going to do that now.  
  
Asri watched her steps. After countless sneaking in and out treasury vaults and other places, she wouldn't want to make a novice mistake like accidentally kicking pebbles and making some loud footstep. The thief moved like a ghost when she sneaked behind Ito. She kept some safe distance between them in case this man turned out to be a threat. _"He needs to have a good explanation for making me go out at cold night like this. Geez, I should have bring my cloak,"_ she thought, shivering a bit. Whether Ito had noticed her presence or not, Asri was standing behind him with three small knives between the fingers of her right hand, ready to be thrown at the target.   
  
**"Don't make any sudden movement, handsome. I am going to put a nice hole your throat if I feel like to."** Asri speak playfully which made the threat sound like a mere joke. Unfortunately, she was serious. **"Please entertain me... Why are you here?"** she added.

Silver steel sliced through shadows in the mottled glow of moonlight, her surroundings wreathed in darkness but the immediate vicinity dimly visible as the light of the moon filtered through the trees around her. She didn't make a great deal of noise, but the swish of her hakama and feet skidding across the ground were barely audible nonetheless; less a ghost than a warrior fighting an invisible battle. But her foes were imaginary, born not of hatred but of ideals; designed not to kill her, but to teach her how to deal with those who would.  
  
Once, Kisaragi had scorned kata. Hokey and meaningless compared to real sparring, she'd thought. But years of practice had driven some inkling of their usefulness into her mind nonetheless - the value of repeating a motion ten thousand times until it was second nature - so that reacting to certain common strikes was not a matter of thought, but of reflex. Internalizing the basics of her trade so she could use her mind on observation and rational thought, not on the battle itself. And she hadn't had much opportunity at all to practice today, too busy helping out at a nearby village. So the Sacaen swordswoman fought against nothingness, rapt within her thoughts and her motions so thoroughly that she would never have noticed anyone's passage unless they were very close indeed... or unless they came crashing down on something, and bells started ringing.  
  
It was fair to say that she wasn't always the most observant individual when caught in the moment, but it was also fair to say that not even Kisaragi could totally ignore the sudden, man-made ruckus in the dead of night, and that par for the course she didn't have enough sense to avoid it.  
  
Whatever the case, it wasn't very difficult to follow the sound of... someone doing... something - washing? there was something disturbing the water anyways, not that she could see jack or crap through the trees. Trying her best to keep an eye out for ambushes and traps, the pint-sized paladin quietly wended her way to her destination... much slower than she would have liked, not being familiar at all with the surroundings like Asri might be. But she did get there without much issue, and thankfully the lighting was a little better in the clearing around the stream than it had been in the deep of the woods. At least enough to see there was someone naked(?) or at least unarmored in the stream, and before she could say anything, a playfully lilting, pleasant voice from somewhere off to the side - but in that sweetly feminine tone was buried a poison so foul it curdled and boiled.  
  
And they were armed, if that glint of steel was any indication. Asri was too far off and not well enough illuminated for Kisaragi to make any real judgement on what sort of weapon she might have, but from the limited perspective she had now, all she could see was a female bandit threatening an unarmed... person in the stream with cruelty, and, well, that didn't exactly gel with her ideals.  
  
Stepping out from the trees with her left hand on the hilt of her sheathed sword, Kisaragi faced the woman with a bit more casual surety than she was actually feeling, acutely aware that it was entirely possible there were a lot more people here than she realized and that she had no idea if the guy(?) in the stream was anything but a villain himself as well. But she refused to be partisan to a murder if there was any chance the victim was innocent. Her voice was neutral but clear, projected firmly, even if it still bore the unmistakable tint of youth that no amount of wishing would change.  
  
**"The same could be asked of you, miss. Threats of violence on those who may be innocent reflect poorly on you."**

Lycia. A place that was both far more desolate than Sacae, yet more alive. The land was not always so green and rolling. Many times, Mizu's feet had come to stride upon deadened brown soil that was deprived of it's oh-so important nutrients. Be it from over-farming, or poor weather and climate, at times the land was visibly decaying. However then there were the population centers. Cities and towns of various sizes scattered or littered about. The few times his nocturnal sleep cycle had been disrupted, which had exposed him to the diurnal population of Lycia, he saw more people gathered than almost any other moment in his life. At-least that many gathered in one relative location.  
  
All in all, he wasn't entirely _opposed_ to Lycia. The people were a varied handful of encounters. Apparently, in Lycia, Sacaen's were at times viewed as primitive from the comments he'd heard muttered or even at times spoken in his direction. However he had stuck to a nocturnal pattern so often that these moments were far and in-between. Enough so that he wasn't dissuaded from traversing the foreign territory further.  
  
Mizuyuki's hand gripped at the small arrow shaft he was currently carving, a light pile of wood shavings littering the small patch of grass before him; dancing orange flickering hues from the camp-fire he'd lit allowed him to see as his hands deftly whittled away at it. The knife that he used guided by a thumb to the flat back of the blade while he carved into the wood to make a rounded shaft. The black and green Yumi that he was whittling arrows to fire from resting on the ground beside him with his quiver of already finished or previously made arrows nestled away. Always one to keep his stock as full as possible, he was diligent to make a few arrows a night when the opportunity presented itself.   
  
The night had been quiet so far. Occasional pops from the campfire, or the crackling as wood was consumed by the voracious appetite of the burning light had really been his only distractions audibly. Aside that was, from the soft churning of the stream near his camp and the various sounds the insects and frogs made. The symphonic background harmony of nature, as it were. It was though, for the most part, a silent night.  
  
His head turned abruptly when he heard the distant jingling. Such an odd, and out of place noise. Something he was not accustomed to hearing, and admittedly was unsure he'd accurately heard. He knew the sound of bells well enough to identify it, but he wasn't sure why bells would be jingling in the starlit hours of the day. Caution and an already natural sense of edge had him well..on edge. Rising from his campsite, and lifting his bow over his shoulder to lightly rest it upon it's holster made by his shoulder strap and belt. The quiver was nestled a moment later nearly parallel to the ground along the length of his waist, resting against the small of his back. Mizu tucked his yukata over pale exposed upper torso so the single sleeve and half covered his shoulder. The other half of his upper torso nearly glowing from the contrast of his ghostly pale skin to the night's sky. The dragon tattoo along his torso standing out further as he quietly placed a hand to the hilt of the blade resting at his hip; quietly creeping through the brush with experience only a life-time in the wild could really generate. Knowing how to hunt, how to track, and how to avoid generating sound, he was accustomed to the path for moving about openly and swiftly without alerting others of his presence.  
  
A narrowed gaze scanned his path ahead, creeping with tucked poise towards what looked like another camp-site down stream. Upon closer approach, he was able to discern voices. Though _what_ they spoke was not plausible to hear, he could in-fact hear that words were being spoken. Fingers coiled tighter around the hilt of his blade and he moved closer to the camp. Close enough that the faintest of ghostly orange hues splashed along his figure to reveal part, while casting the other half in shadows that seemed all the darker due to the shade light usually created when cast upon something. It seemed to be..three.  
  
Two women, and one boy. The male far easier to spot, albeit nearly embraced by closeness of another while a third took the stance of what he guessed was an onlooker. Mizu could've drawn attention to himself, but why do that when they were so focused already. He would wait and observe the show unfolding further, hand silently resting in darkness atop the hilt of his blade in the event that things turned sour.

**"Don't make any sudden movement, handsome. I am going to put a nice hole your throat if I feel like to. Please entertain me... Why are you here?"**  
  
Ito dropped his shirt into the stream in surprise. He had been caught, and now had to come up with some way to get out of it. The voice's owner stood behind him, and although the female tone was playful, Ito guessed there was a bit of truth to the 'hole in the throat' statement. Then, another female voice, this one younger, however, rang out from a bit further behind him than the last one. **"The same could be asked of you, miss. Threats of violence on those who may be innocent reflect poorly on you."** Thank goodness. _Someone willing to help,_ the voice in Ito's head said. Slowly, he turned around with his hands in the air, to face the two newcomers.   
  
_Wow._ Both of them were women, attractive ones at that, and Ito guessed them both to be younger than himself, one older than the other though. Ito felt a tinge of embarrassment as he realised he was shirtless; his lean, strong musculature exposed in the moonlight, and his sword, armor, and shirt resting in the stream. "Uh... I-I uh... Hi." _Gosh, Ito,_ he thought, _now's not the time! Think!_  
  
He cleared his throat, then tried to speak again. "Yes. Um... Your question, uh, long story." He moved his right hand up and rubbed the back of his neck. _**How am I supposed to explain being covered in blood?**_ The substance had dried on during his initial exit, spotting his arms, face, equipment, and clothing. "You see, um, well... I was running, and I uh, I got caught in some tripwire." He looked into the eyes of the red head holding the knives, the depression he'd been feeling for years showing in his blue eyes. "I assume that belonged to you? Sorry for... getting caught in it."   
  
Ito felt flustered; His depression-led actions up to this point had limited his interaction with other people to a minimalistic level, almost obsolete in its entirety. Now, he was faced by two women, one of which was likely to injure him if he didn't explain his situation, and he couldn't think of words to say. Looking calm, Ito silently planned his next actions carefully in case things turned south.

Well, there wasn't an immediate explosion of violence, which was nice. She had stepped in fully aware that things might end very badly for her and done it anyways, but Kisaragi wasn't exactly too shy to admit to herself that she was pretty glad she wasn't dead right now. That was the, ah, downside of being a self-aware idiot, sometimes you KNEW you were walking into a possible trap... but had to do it anyways. Honestly, she wasn't sure if that made her brave or stupid... just kidding, it was definitely the second one, but it was nice to pretend to be brave, heh.  
  
All self-congratulatory bullshit aside though, as her eyes adjusted better to the newfound light of the moonlit night, the Sacaen sword ~~waifu~~ woman realized WHY the man was taking a bath in the middle of the friggin' night - it was hard to see the specifics, but it sure as heck looked like he'd taken a bath in a barrel of tomato sauce... thick and sticky tomato sauce... that was blood wasn't it? God dammit. If she hadn't been taught to keep her thoughts to herself except when necessary, Kisaragi would have started swearing then and there, stricken by the thought that it was entirely possible she was 'saving' a mass murderer or something or orphan eater or something equally heinous. In fairness, his stammered greetings and halting explanation didn't exactly sound like the work of a soulless murder hobo, but she wasn't 100% sure.  
  
And why had he been running? Was he fleeing pursuit, and if so, was it for a good deed, or an ill one? Ah the wonders of morality! Sometimes she wished she could just flip a coin to decide whether or not someone needed a boot to the head and a face full of JUSTICE! But in this case she was stuck relying on her head, and while it was pretty tough after a few too many blows to the skull, she wasn't quite as confident in her overwhelming intellect. Going by the armor and weapon, he was probably capable of defending himself at least... but was that a good thing in this case? By the Sky but it would be nice if the good guys and the bad guys were all just labeled for easy recognition. **"...I don't know if I should hope that blood is yours or someone else's."** Kisaragi sighed, the joke sounding pretty flat even to her. She angled her head towards Ito, still keeping an eye on the bandit(?) lady in case she tried anything crazy. **"But at least tell me that it was shed in the name of justice. I don't need to know anything else."**
