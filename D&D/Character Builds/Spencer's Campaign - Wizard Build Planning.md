- Creature Type: Humanoid
- Size: Medium
- Speed: 30 feet, Fly 30 feet
- Age. Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.
- Darkvision. Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
- Hellish Resistance. You have resistance to fire damage.
- Winged. You have bat-like wings sprouting from your shoulder blades. You have a flying speed of 30 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.
- Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.
- Appearance. Your tiefling might not look like other tieflings. Rather than having the physical characteristics described in the Player's Handbook, choose 1d4+1 of the following features: small horns; fangs or sharp teeth; a forked tongue; catlike eyes; six fingers on each hand; goatlike legs; cloven hoofs; a forked tail; leathery or scaly skin; red or dark blue skin; cast no shadow or reflection; exude a smell of brimstone.

Going Winged Tiefling gets free, at-will flight--very good for movement and positioning, especially kiting melee enemies. Darkvision is practically a necessity, and the fire resistance is also very nice. Human is a good alternative--I'd probably pick the Tough feat, Musician for support, or one of the Magic Initiate feats for relevant spell needs. Extra feat to start is OP.

**Background** - Criminal
- Ability Scores: **Dexterity**, Constitution, **Intelligence**
- Feat: [Alert](https://5e.tools/feats.html#alert_xphb)
- Skill Proficiencies: Sleight of Hand, Stealth
- Tool Proficiency: [Thieves' Tools](https://5e.tools/items.html#thieves'%20tools_xphb)
- Equipment: Choose A or **B**: (A) [2 Daggers](https://5e.tools/items.html#dagger_xphb), [Thieves' Tools](https://5e.tools/items.html#thieves'%20tools_xphb), [Crowbar](https://5e.tools/items.html#crowbar_xphb), [2 Pouches](https://5e.tools/items.html#pouch_xphb), [Traveler's Clothes](https://5e.tools/items.html#traveler's%20clothes_xphb), 16 GP; or (B) 50 GP

Background is perfect for the desired character flavour, the skills are nice to have (though we won’t be as good as a rogue) the feat is excellent, and the ability scores are perfect. Taking starting gold, rather than equipment.

**Ability Scores**:
Using Point Buy,
| Str 9, Dex 13+1, Con 14, Int 15+2, Wis 13, Cha 8 |

**Starting Equipment:**
Taking starting gold. DM allowed Ranger starting gold instead of Wizard, so we have an overall budget of 200 gp. Take the following:
- Scale Mail (50 gp)
- Shield (10 gp)
- Sprig of Mistletoe (1 gp)
- Spellbook (50 gp)
- Warhammer (15 gp)
- Thieves’ Tools (25 gp)
- Ink (10 gp)
- Ink Pen (0.02 gp)
- Basic Fishing Equipment (0.1 gp)
- Bullseye Lantern (10 gp)
- Crowbar (2 gp)
- Cold-Weather Clothing (10 gp)
- Snowshoes (2 gp)
- Pole (0.05 gp)
- Portable Ram (4 gp)
- Robe (1 gp)
- Signal Whistle (0.05 gp)
- Waterskin (0.2 gp)
- Pouch (0.5 gp)
- Backpack (2 gp)
- Costume (5 gp)
- Flask of Oil (0.1 gp)
- Jug (0.02 gp)
- Sack (0.01 gp)

If I did the math correctly, this loadout leaves us with 1 gold piece, 9 silver pieces, and 5 copper pieces. This homie is definitely living the “wretched” lifestyle, lmao.


First purchasing goal is half-plate. After that, worry about finding spellbooks and spell scrolls to fill out own spellbook. Would be good to get a backup spellbook in case the main one goes missing.

**Class Progression**:

Level 1 - **Wizard 1**
- 

{Explanation}

Level 2 - Wizard 1/**Ranger 1**
- Spellcasting (Cantrips: Guidance, Mending, Spare the Dying; Level 1: Bless, Command, Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt)
- Divine Order (Thaumaturge: Thaumaturgy; Wis mod bonus to Arcana and Religion checks)

This is the armour dip. Also picking up weapon mastery and some utility spells, thx Ranger for something usable :)

Level 3 - **Wizard 2**/Ranger 1
- Channel Divinity
- Prepared Spells (Level 1: Bless, Command, Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt, **Shield of Faith**)

Channel Divinity pulls us deeper into the Cleric identity; Divine Spark will probably be a more-used option for some extra ally healing, but Turn Undead will be useful enough if encountering Undead creatures. 

Level 4 - Fighter 1/**Cleric 3**
- Cleric Subclass (Trickery Domain)
	- Trickery Domain Spells
	- Blessing of the Trickster
	- Invoke Duplicity
- Prepared Spells (Level 1: Bless, Command, Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt, Shield of Faith; Level 2: **Charm Person, Disguise Self, Invisibility, Pass without Trace, Silence**)

It's here! The subclass we've been waiting for! Invoke Duplicity gets us free advantage in combat (perfect for our True Strike greatsword attacks) and has fun roleplay potential. Blessing of the Trickster is perfect for our roguish focus, and the spell list is the perfect compliment to our "medieval pentester" flavour.

Level 5 - Fighter 1/**Cleric 4**
- Ability Score Increase/Feat
	- War Caster (+Wis)
- Prepared Spells (Level 1: Bless, Command, Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt, Shield of Faith; Level 2: **Aid**, Charm Person, Disguise Self, Invisibility, Pass without Trace, Silence)

This puts our Wis up to +4, rounds out our Concentration protection, lets us take Reaction attacks with True Strike, and lets us do Somatic components when our hand are full. Very cool. Aid is a good prepped spell, but all of our spells can be changed daily depending on party needs. This is the last time (for now) that we'll be boosting our Wisdom score.

Level 6 - Fighter 1/**Cleric 5**
- Sear Undead
- Prepared Spells (Level 1: Bless, Command, Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt, Shield of Faith; Level 2: Aid, Charm Person, Disguise Self, Invisibility, Pass without Trace, Silence; **Level 3: Hypnotic Pattern, Meld into Stone, Nondetection, Spirit Guardians**)

Very good level for us, because we get the Spirit Guardians spell (finally!).
