- Creature Type: Humanoid
- Size: Medium
- Speed: 30 feet, Fly 30 feet
- Age. Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.
- Darkvision. Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
- Hellish Resistance. You have resistance to fire damage.
- Winged. You have bat-like wings sprouting from your shoulder blades. You have a flying speed of 30 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.
- Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.
- Appearance. Your tiefling might not look like other tieflings. Rather than having the physical characteristics described in the Player's Handbook, choose 1d4+1 of the following features: small horns; fangs or sharp teeth; a forked tongue; catlike eyes; six fingers on each hand; goatlike legs; cloven hoofs; a forked tail; leathery or scaly skin; red or dark blue skin; cast no shadow or reflection; exude a smell of brimstone.

Going Winged Tiefling gets free, at-will flight--very good for movement and positioning, especially kiting melee enemies. 

Grabbing Investigation for flavour, proficiency will be a nice boost to the initial +0 on Int checks. Consider Arcana for scribing spell scrolls, but can get that later.

We'll be boosting Dex later on down the road.

Picking Medium as the size is less good if considering using a mount, but I like it better and (might? definitely in 2014 rules) needed it to use greatswords.

**Background** - Criminal (Custom)
- Ability Scores: **Dexterity**, Constitution, **Wisdom**
- Feat: [Alert](https://5e.tools/feats.html#alert_xphb)
- Skill Proficiencies: Sleight of Hand, Stealth
- Tool Proficiency: [Thieves' Tools](https://5e.tools/items.html#thieves'%20tools_xphb)
- Equipment: Choose A or **B**: (A) [2 Daggers](https://5e.tools/items.html#dagger_xphb), [Thieves' Tools](https://5e.tools/items.html#thieves'%20tools_xphb), [Crowbar](https://5e.tools/items.html#crowbar_xphb), [2 Pouches](https://5e.tools/items.html#pouch_xphb), [Traveler's Clothes](https://5e.tools/items.html#traveler's%20clothes_xphb), 16 GP; or (B) 50 GP

Background is perfect for the desired character flavour, but needs one small tweak to the ability scores: swapping Intelligence for Wisdom. Put the +2 in Wisdom, and the +1 in either Dexterity or Constitution depending on point buy actions. I went with Dexterity to push it to 16.

**Ability Scores**:
Using Point Buy,
| Str 8, Dex 15+1, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 15+2, Cha 8 |

**Starting Equipment:**

Fighter starts with 155 gp, Criminals start with 50. Buy Thieves' Tools, Greatsword, Longbow, Quiver(s), Arrows, and Scale Mail. Consider saving the gold, but feel free to purchase any mundane equipment you might need (consider ten-foot poles and crowbars for dealing with traps). When Dex gets higher later, consider swapping to studded leather armour.

Purchasing goals are flexible.

**Class Progression**:

Level 1 - **Fighter 1**
- Fighting Style: Defense is the pick here, but Archery was worth considering.
- Second Wind: Very good, especially at lower levels. Will be more useful later when we take a second Fighter level.
- Weapon Mastery: Greatsword, Longbow, and a flex pick. Tempted to pick up Shortbow or Rapier.

Fighter 1 gets Constitution save proficiency. This will be crucial for boosting the utility we get from Cleric later when needing to maintain concentration. We also gain access to all armour, weapons, and shields, and our most important skill proficiency, Perception. Other skill pick is flexible, I'm going with Insight for now; might change by the time the campaign actually starts.

Level 2 - Fighter 1/**Cleric 1**
- Spellcasting (Cantrips: Guidance, Mending, Spare the Dying; Level 1: Bless, Command, Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt)
- Divine Order (Thaumaturge: Thaumaturgy; Wis mod bonus to Arcana and Religion checks)

This is step one of the core of our build. We're focusing on the Trickery Domain as our core identity, and building around it to supplement the core and strengthen its utility niches while trying to bolster our typical Cleric role and boost our single-target damage to a reasonable degree. 

Level 3 - Fighter 1/**Cleric 2**
- Channel Divinity
- Prepared Spells (Level 1: Bless, Command, Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt, **Shield of Faith**)

Channel Divinity pulls us deeper into the Cleric identity; Divine Spark will probably be a more-used option for some extra ally healing, but Turn Undead will be useful enough if encountering Undead creatures. 

Level 4 - Fighter 1/**Cleric 3**
- Cleric Subclass (Trickery Domain)
	- Trickery Domain Spells
	- Blessing of the Trickster
	- Invoke Duplicity
- Prepared Spells (Level 1: Bless, Command, Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt, Shield of Faith; Level 2: **Charm Person, Disguise Self, Invisibility, Pass without Trace, Silence**)

It's here! The subclass we've been waiting for! Invoke Duplicity gets us free advantage in combat (perfect for our True Strike greatsword attacks) and has fun roleplay potential. Blessing of the Trickster is perfect for our roguish focus, and the spell list is the perfect compliment to our "medieval pentester" flavour.

Level 5 - Fighter 1/**Cleric 4**
- Ability Score Increase/Feat
	- War Caster (+Wis)
- Prepared Spells (Level 1: Bless, Command, Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt, Shield of Faith; Level 2: **Aid**, Charm Person, Disguise Self, Invisibility, Pass without Trace, Silence)

This puts our Wis up to +4, rounds out our Concentration protection, lets us take Reaction attacks with True Strike, and lets us do Somatic components when our hand are full. Very cool. Aid is a good prepped spell, but all of our spells can be changed daily depending on party needs. This is the last time (for now) that we'll be boosting our Wisdom score.

Level 6 - Fighter 1/**Cleric 5**
- Sear Undead
- Prepared Spells (Level 1: Bless, Command, Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt, Shield of Faith; Level 2: Aid, Charm Person, Disguise Self, Invisibility, Pass without Trace, Silence; **Level 3: Hypnotic Pattern, Meld into Stone, Nondetection, Spirit Guardians**)

Very good level for us, because we get the Spirit Guardians spell (finally!).
