## Diet
### 🛒 The Grocery List
This list avoids avocados, tomatoes, beans, peppers, and olives. It focuses on the $50–$60 weekly budget.
1. The "Staff of Life" (Carbs/Grains)
 * Dry Lentils (Green or Brown): Extremely cheap. They cook in 20 minutes (no soaking required like beans).
 * White or Brown Rice: Buy the biggest bag you can carry.
 * Russet Potatoes: 5lb or 10lb bag. (Keep them in a dark place so they don't sprout).
 * Old Fashioned Oats: Great for your late-night "breakfast-at-night" meal.
2. The "Strength" (Proteins)
 * Large Pack of Eggs: Your most versatile protein.
 * Chicken Thighs (Bone-in/Skin-on): Usually the cheapest cut. Roast them all at once on Sunday.
 * Canned Tuna: For quick protein if you're running late for work.
 * Ground Turkey or Lean Beef: Use "sparingly" as a base for your potato hashes.
3. The "Wholesome Herbs" (Veggies/Fruits)
 * Frozen Broccoli: Cheap, zero waste.
 * Frozen Spinach: Easy to stir into your lentils or rice.
 * Carrots: Cheap, lasts forever in the fridge, and provides a good "crunch."
 * Apples or Bananas: The best "on-the-go" fruit for your campus commutes.
4. Pantry Essentials (Flavor)
 * Soy Sauce: Perfect for your rice/lentil/egg bowls.
 * Garlic Powder & Onion Powder: Adds flavor without needing peppers or tomatoes.
 * Peanut Butter: For fats and satiety during your fasting window.
### 👨‍🍳 The "Lentil-Rice" Prep (The Sunday Ritual)
Since you have a late lunch, you need a meal you can grab and go.
 * Boil 1 cup of lentils and 1 cup of rice together (use 4 cups of water or broth).
 * Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
 * Top with a fried egg when you're ready to eat.
   Cost per serving: Roughly $0.75.

#### 🛡️ Survival Tip for your First Week
Starting a 16/8 fast while increasing physical activity can lead to "brain fog" during your 15 credits of classes. To prevent this:
 * Salt your water: Add a tiny pinch of salt to your water in the morning. Since you aren't eating breakfast, your electrolytes might dip.
 * The Lentil Load: Make sure your late lunch is heavy on the lentils and rice. You need those complex carbs to fuel your brain for your afternoon work shift.

## Exercise
Building a tactical physique from scratch without a gym is actually how many elite operators train when deployed. Since we are targeting US Intelligence (FBI/CI) standards, we aren't training for "show"—we are training for output.
At 230 lbs, your first priority is protecting your joints while building the "engine" (your heart and lungs) and the "chassis" (your muscles).
### 🛡️ The "Field Ready" Weekly Schedule
This plan alternates between Strength (S) and Conditioning (C). It’s designed to be done in a dorm, a park, or even a breakroom at work.
| Day | Focus | Activity |
|---|---|---|
| Monday | Strength | Total Body Calisthenics (Circuit A) |
| Tuesday | Conditioning | "The Commuter Special" (Rucking/Intervals) |
| Wednesday | Strength | Total Body Calisthenics (Circuit B) |
| Thursday | Conditioning | Active Recovery (Brisk Walking + Mobility) |
| Friday | Strength | Total Body Calisthenics (Circuit A) |
| Saturday | Endurance | Long Slow Distance (LSD) - 30-45 min walk/jog |
| Sunday | Rest | Complete Rest or Light Stretching |
#### 🏋️ The No-Equipment Strength Circuits
Do these as a circuit: Move from one exercise to the next with 30 seconds of rest. Complete the full circuit 3–4 times.
##### Circuit A: The PFT Foundation
 * Push-ups (Max Reps): Keep elbows tucked at a 45-degree angle. If you can't do a full push-up, do them with your hands on a desk or bed (incline).
 * Bulgarian Split Squats (12 reps/leg): Put one foot behind you on a chair or bed. This builds the unilateral leg strength needed for sprinting.
 * "Table Rows" (10 reps): Lay under a sturdy table, grab the edge, and pull your chest to the table. This is your "no-gym" pull-up substitute.
 * Plank (60 seconds): Keep your core tight—this is vital for the stability needed in surveillance work.
##### Circuit B: Explosive Power
 * Diamond Push-ups (Max Reps): Hands close together. This targets triceps, which are the "finishers" for standard push-ups.
 * Walking Lunges (20 steps total): Great for hip mobility and lower body endurance.
 * Superman Extensions (15 reps): Lay on your belly and lift your arms and legs. This strengthens the lower back (critical if you’ll be carrying gear later).
 * Mountain Climbers (45 seconds): Fast knees to chest. This mimics the "kick" you need at the end of a 1.5-mile run.
#### 🏃 Conditioning: "The Commuter Special"
Since you are already walking 10-15 minutes across campus, we’re going to "weaponize" those walks.
 * The Ruck: Put 10-15 lbs of books in your backpack for your walks. This increases calorie burn by roughly 30-50% without adding extra time to your day.
 * The Hill Sprint: If your campus has a hill or a long set of stairs, sprint up it for 30 seconds once during your commute, then walk the rest of the way to catch your breath.
## Progression Tracking
This tracker is designed to bridge the gap between your current "student-worker" hustle and your future as a tactical professional. Since Feb. 16 is a Monday, it’s the perfect day to kick off Week 1.
We are going to break this into three distinct phases.
### 🗓️ Phase 1: The "Senior Spring" (Feb 16 – July 23, 2026)
Primary Goal: Weight Loss & Foundation.
During this phase, you are still balancing 15 credits and 20 work hours. Your goal isn't to be an Olympian yet; it’s to shed the weight that makes gravity your enemy.
#### | Month | Target Weight | PFT Focus | Key Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|
| Feb 16 | 230 lbs | Establish "Baseline" numbers | Day 1: Take "before" photos & log initial max push-ups. |
| March | 222 lbs | Form over Speed | Consistent 3x/week bodyweight circuits. |
| April | 215 lbs | The "Commuter Ruck" | Add 10 lbs to your backpack for all campus walks. |
| May | 208 lbs | Push-up Volume | Aim for 20+ continuous push-ups. |
| June | 202 lbs | Intro to Running | Start the 1.5-mile jog (no walking breaks). |
| July 23 | 195-198 lbs | Graduation Day | Pass the "1 Point" minimum for FBI Push-ups (30 reps). |
### 🗓️ Phase 2: The "Post-Grad Pivot" (July 24 – Dec 31, 2026)
Primary Goal: Conditioning & Body Composition.
You’ve graduated. You likely have more time but less structure. This is the danger zone for weight regain, so we increase the intensity.
 * Weight Goal: 185 lbs by New Year’s Eve.
 * The Shift: Transition from "Table Rows" to finding a park with a pull-up bar. Since you'll be ~35 lbs lighter than today, your first "real" pull-up will happen here.
 * Intelligence Prep: Start reading CI-specific material (like The Craft of Intelligence by Allen Dulles) to keep your mind in the game while you train.
### 🗓️ Phase 3: The "Elite Gap Year" (Jan 2027 – Sept 2027)
Primary Goal: Peak PFT Scoring.
By now, you should be at your goal weight of 175–180 lbs. Now we stop focusing on the scale and focus entirely on the clock and the reps.
 * Jan - March: Focus on the 300m Sprint. This is a "lung burner."
 * April - June: Mock PFT every 1st of the month.
 * July - Sept: Final prep before grad school. You want to enter grad school already physically "cleared" so you can focus on your Master's/CI specialized studies.
### 📊 Weekly Progress Log
Copy this into a notes app or a physical notebook. Only log once a week to avoid scale obsession.
> Date: {Monday Morning}
> Weight: {Weight} lbs
> Push-ups (Max): {Reps}
> 1.5 Mile Time: {Minutes:Seconds}
> "Grease the Groove" Consistency: {High/Med/Low}
> Budget Nutrition Score: {1-10} (Did I stick to the Rice/Potato/Protein plan?)
#### Baseline Instructions/PFT Scoring
To calculate your baseline on Monday, Feb. 16, we will use the FBI Point System. Since you are currently at 230 lbs, do not be discouraged if your initial score is in the negatives or zeros. In the intelligence world, the "Initial Assessment" is simply the baseline for the "After Action Report."
Here is how you will calculate your score based on the Male (Age 25–29) standards:
##### 🧮 The Scoring Formula
To "Pass" the FBI PFT, you must achieve:
 * At least 1 point in each of the 4 categories.
 * A Total Cumulative Score of 10.
1. Pull-ups (Vertical Pull)
 * 0 Points: 0–1 reps
 * 1 Point: 2 reps
 * 2 Points: 3–4 reps
 * 5 Points: 10–11 reps
 * 10 Points: 20 reps
> Note: If you cannot do a pull-up yet, your score is 0. We will use "Table Rows" to build the strength to get that first point.
> 
2. Push-ups (Continuous)
 * -2 Points: 0–19 reps
 * 0 Points: 20–29 reps
 * 1 Point: 30–32 reps
 * 5 Points: 50–53 reps
 * 10 Points: 71+ reps
3. 1.5-Mile Run (Endurance)
 * -2 Points: 13:30+ minutes
 * 0 Points: 12:25–13:29 minutes
 * 1 Point: 12:24–12:15 minutes
 * 5 Points: 10:34–10:15 minutes
 * 10 Points: 8:59 or less
4. 300m Sprint (Anaerobic)
 * -2 Points: 55.1+ seconds
 * 0 Points: 52.5–55.0 seconds
 * 1 Point: 52.4–51.1 seconds
 * 5 Points: 46.0–45.0 seconds
 * 10 Points: 40.9 or less
##### 📋 Monday Morning "Baseline" Instructions
Since you skip breakfast, do your physical testing before your late lunch (around 12:00 PM or 1:00 PM) to see how your body performs in a fasted state—a common scenario in field operations.
 * The Scale: Record your weight first thing.
 * The Test: * Find a local track or a flat stretch of road measured to 1.5 miles (use a phone app).
   * Do the Push-ups first.
   * Rest 5 minutes.
   * Do the 300m Sprint (roughly 3/4 of a standard track lap).
   * Rest 5 minutes.
   * Do the 1.5-mile Run.
 * The Math: Total your points. If you are at -4 or 0 total points, that is perfectly normal for Day 1.
