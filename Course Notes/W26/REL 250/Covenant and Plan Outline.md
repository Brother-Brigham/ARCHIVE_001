Verse Reference: Revelation 12

Doctrine/Principle: Premortal war in heaven, Satan's opposition against the believers/the church

Summary of Verses: Revelation 12 depicts a woman clothed with the sun who brings forth a child, and a dragon which takes a third part of the stars in the heavens that is attempting to devour the child. The child is taken up to the throne of God. Michael and his angels make war against the dragon, and it is cast out of heaven to earth. It is announced that they have overcome and cast our Satan by the power of God's Christ, through the blood of the lamb. The dragon then persecutes the woman, who is helped by the earth, so Satan makes war against the remainder of the woman's seed.

Potential Application/Insight: Satan was cast out of heaven for rebelling against Christ. He took with him many angels and persecutes those who believe in Christ, but we can receive salvation, strength, and overcome Satan through the power of Christ and his blood, by the word of our testimonies.
