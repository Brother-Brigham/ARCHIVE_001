## Theognis
The voice of the bird, Polypaides, loudly shouting
	I heard, which to mortals comes a messenger of 
plowing; and struck my heart black, 
	because to me others have fair-flowering fields.
## The Good Samaritan (concluded)
Jesus answering said, "A certain man was coming down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell to thieves, and they having stripped him and having put blows on him they went, having left him half dead. By chance, a certain priest was coming down on that road and having seen him went past on the other side; and likewise, a Levite, having come to the place and having seen, went past on the other side. But a certain journeying Samaritan having come down to him and having seen was filled with pity, and coming to him he bound up his wounds, pouring on olive oil and wine, and, having mounted him upon his own beast, he brought him to an inn and he cared for him. ... Which of these three seems to you to have been the neighbour of the one who fell among the thieves?" And he said, "The one who had pity on him." And Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."
