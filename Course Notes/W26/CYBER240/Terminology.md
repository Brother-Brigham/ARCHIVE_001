PAN - Personal Area Networks (smallest widely-used form of network we have)
- Essentially the short range between your phone and bluetooth/wifi devices
LAN - Local Area Networks
WAN - Wide Area Networks
MAN - Metropolitan Area Networks
SAN - Storage Area Networks (Used for specialized, high-speed information storage and retrieval)

Difference between LAN and WAN is a little squishy. Depends on distance as main determinant. We use a change in technology to help the networks cover wider areas, helping distinguish between LAN and WAN.

MANs are city-sized networks, but a little difficult to run.

ISO-OSI model
7 - Application
6 - Presentation
5 - Session
4 - Transport
3 - Network
2 - Data-Link
1 - Physical

Requests move down the layers from 7 to 1, with different devices processing at different layers.

**Application**
- What is used to interface with/create data
**Presentation**
- Ensures data is in the proper format to be passed up to the application in a readable
